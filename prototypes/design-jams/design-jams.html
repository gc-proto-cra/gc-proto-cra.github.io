	<p>The Canada Revenue Agency holds design jams to help improve the services it offers.</p>
    
<h2>What are design jams?</h2>
	<p>Design jams are workshops that bring together participants from various backgrounds, including applicants and taxpayers, to develop ideas that improve services.</p> 
    <p>The design jams focus on specific service challenges that were selected from proposals submitted by our employees across the Agency, as well as the Taxpayers' Ombudsman. </p>
<h2>The Design Jam Process</h2>
	<h3>Define</h3>
    <p>Use existing insights from research to lead us to defining the main issue with a “how might we” statement that clearly outlines the problem needed to be explored.</p>
        <p>“How might we” statements are helpful in identifying complex service challenges which are not fully understood and/or missing a ready solution</p>

    <h3>Understand</h3>
    <p>Conduct interviews with people (external and internal) that have experience with, or knowledge about, the service challenge to better understand their perspective and experience with the current state.</p>
    <p>Analyze the results of the interviews to identify key insights and pain points.</p>
	
    <h3>Explore</h3>
    <p>In a one-day workshop, with a diverse group of participants from various backgrounds, come to a common understanding of the research findings and work together to explore potential solutions that address pain points.</p>
    <p>Develop and refine the ideas proposed, then transform them into prototypes.</p>
    
	<h3>Test</h3>
    <p>Begin to look into and build on the ideas developed in the workshop.</p>
    <p>Perform testing with the people that would use the product or service as it is being developed to adjust or improve as needed.</p>

<h2>What happens during a design jam?</h2>
	<p>During the design jams, participants answer questions such as: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>What do clients need?</li>
			<li>What difficulties do they face?</li>
			<li>How can we make their experience better? </li>

		</ul>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left">
	<img src="images/image2.jpeg" alt="cork board" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: auto;">
	<p>Participants come together to come up with and build mock-ups of ideas. 
	The goal following a design jam is to take what was learned to improve services and to test ideas  to see how they work for the people who will be using them. 
	Based on the testing, the ideas will be refined, retested as needed, and if they test well, they will be implemented for people to use. </p>
</div>
    
    
<h2>Who participates in design jams?</h2>
	<p>Each design jam includes participants who have personal experience with the service challenge or have knowledge on the topic, from both inside and outside the CRA. </p>

<h2>Service Challenge</h2>
<p>
    The Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) is a collaboration between the CRA and community organizations. 
    These organizations across Canada host free tax preparation clinics and arrange for volunteers to prepare income tax and benefit returns for eligible individuals.
<br>
To be eligible, individuals must have a modest income and a simple tax situation. 
Under current guidelines, individuals with self-employment earnings are not eligible, even if they meet the other criteria.
<br>
Although the guidelines make these clients ineligible, these types of clients are seeking support and the organizations and volunteers are eager to help them. 
This design jam will look into how we can support individuals with modest income and self-employment earnings to file their taxes successfully. 
</p>

<h2>Improving the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) Review Process</h2>
<h3>Service Challenge</h3>
<p>The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is available to eligible Canadians who have a child under 18 years of age. 
    Eligibility is based on family net income, as reported in the previous year’s tax return, and other factors. 
    Sometimes individuals have to go through a review process, sometimes long after they have already received the benefit. 
    We have heard, through different sources, that some Canadians find this review process difficult. 
    This design jam will look into the barriers that Canadians experience when they are going through the review, and will explore ways to improve the process. 
</p>

<h3>Service Challenge</h3>
    <p>
    The Candidate Profile is the system that job candidates outside the Agency and CRA employees use when they want to apply for a position with us. 
    We held a design jam to gain insight into how to make the tool easier to use.

<div style="display:block;text-align:left">
<h3>Insights gained from the design jam</h3>
    <p>During the design jam, participants had the following insights:</p>
        <ul><li>Applicants sometimes feel like they are being audited, instead of participating in a tax incentive program. 
        Sometimes companies are nervous to have CRA employees in their building because they are trying to follow rules that they don’t fully understand.</li>
        <li>Technology is changing rapidly and the definitions about what is “innovative” change quickly.</li>
        <li>The application process takes a lot of time and sometimes companies wonder if the benefits outweigh the costs of participating.</li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left">
<img src="images/image4.png" alt="Prototype idea board"style="float: right; width: 350px; margin: auto;">
<h3>Proposals developed during the design jam</h3>
    <p>Participants proposed a variety of solutions, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>developing an Online SR&amp;ED Community Portal</li>
        <li>introducing a new way of gathering information for SR&amp;ED projects</li>
        <li>updated custom questions for different industry sectors, and</li>
        <li>a new tool that would provide applicants with immediate feedback on the status of their projects.</li>
    </ul>

</div>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>Feedback received through the Design Jam process have provided the CRA with a deeper understanding of the client’s experience in making a SR&amp;ED claim. 
     The insights expressed from the claimant and tax preparer communities will also inform the future direction of the SR&amp;ED tax incentive program. 
     Moving forward, the CRA has committed to developing solutions based on the results of the Design Jam that will further improve client experience with the program, 
     while communicating our progress to program stakeholders at the earliest possible opportunities.</p>
