    <details>
      <summary>Why are the  Recovery Benefits replacing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
      <p>The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was an important and  necessary temporary response to support Canadians who stopped working because  of COVID-19. </p>
      <p>The CERB covered 3 broad circumstances where individuals would have  had to stop working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>their job not being  available</li>
        <li>being sick, quarantined, or in self-isolation, or </li>
        <li>having to care for a child or other family member requiring supervised care whose normal care facility was closed due to COVID or was sick with COVID-19</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As we safely restart Canada's economy, the Government is transitioning most  Canadians who still cannot work to a simplified Employment Insurance program,  effective September 27, 2020. </p>
      <p>For those who are not eligible to receive EI regular benefits, such as the self-employed, or those experiencing a reduction in income of at least 50% due to COVID-19, the Government has introduced the Canada Recovery Benefit. This temporary benefit provides $500 per week (taxable) for up to 38 weeks between September 27, 2020 and September 25, 2021. To be eligible for the Benefit, you must be available and looking for work and must accept work, when it is reasonable to do so.</p>
      <p>The Government has also introduced the temporary Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit.</p>
      <p>These 3 Recovery benefits ensure Canadians continue to have access to much needed tailored support similar to the CERB.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I receive the  Recovery Benefits if I am not a citizen or a permanent resident?</summary>
      <p>Yes, as long as you are residing and present in Canada during the period  for which you are claiming the benefits and meet the other eligibility criteria.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I receive the  Recovery Benefits if I am a citizen of Canada but living abroad temporarily and  couldn't get home once the pandemic started? </summary>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>To be eligible for the Recovery Benefits, you must be residing and  present in Canada during the period for which you claim the benefits.</p>
    </details>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="access">Access</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>When can I access  the Recovery Benefits? </summary>
      <p>Unlike  the CERB and CESB, the recovery benefit periods are retroactive. This means  that applicants can only apply for a recovery benefit after the period for  which they're applying has ended. In addition, applicants must apply within 60  days after the period for which they are applying has ended. </p>
      <p>The CRA launched the application  process for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) and the Canada Recovery  Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) on October 5, 2020. </p>
      <p>Applications for the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) started  October 12, 2020.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I apply for  the Recovery Benefits? </summary>

      <p>No. </p>
      <p>You cannot claim more than one of the Recovery Benefits for the same  period. </p>
      <p>You may also not get the Recovery Benefits if you are getting Employment  Insurance benefits, provincial maternity or parental benefits, or any other  paid leave for the same period.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I get more than  one of the Recovery Benefits between September 27, 2020 and September 25, 2021? </summary>
      <p>Yes, as long as you meet the relevant  eligibility criteria. </p>
      <p>However, you cannot claim more than one of the Recovery Benefits for the  same period. </p>
      <p>You may also not get the Recovery Benefits if you are getting Employment  Insurance benefits, provincial maternity or parental benefits, or any other  paid leave for the same period.</p>

      <details><summary>What happens if I am expecting to exhaust my benefits by March 27, 2021?</summary>
      <p>The government has approved an increase in the number of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) of 12 weeks, extending the maximum duration of the benefits from 26 weeks to up to 38 weeks.

    <details>
      <summary>When will I start  receiving the Recovery Benefits? Will I get it as soon as I exhaust my CERB benefits? </summary>
      <p>The CRA launched the application process for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) on October 5, 2020. Applications for the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) began being accepted starting October 12, 2020. </p>
      <p>Similar  to Employment Insurance, these benefits will be paid on an arrears basis which  mean CERB clients will be switching from being paid in advance of the period  where you are unable to work to paying you after the period you could not work.  With this switch, you will experience a break  in payments. The length of the break will depend on which Benefit is being  applied for and for what period.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Why is payment changing to arrears when the  CERB was paid in advance for anticipated time unable to work? </summary>
      <p>The Recovery  Benefits will be paid following the period where you were not working, to allow  you to attest to the fact that you were unable to work for the time for which  you are claiming the Benefit.  This is  consistent with how the Employment Insurance Benefits are administered.  This will help ensure that people are getting  the Benefits for a period for which they are entitled, and avoid the need to  repay benefits if they apply but then are able to work.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How long do I have to apply for one of the  Recovery Benefits after my period of not working? </summary>
      <p>The Recovery Benefits are  available between September 27, 2020 and September 25, 2021.</p>
      <p>You have 60 days to apply after the end of the period for which you need  the benefit.</p>
      <p>For example, if you couldn't work due to COVID-19 for the 2-week period between September 27 and October 10, 2020, you can apply for this 2-week period until December 9, 2020.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Once I receive my first payment, can I  assume that I will continue to receive my next payments without doing anything? </summary>
      <p>No, the renewal of  payments will not be automatic.</p>
      <p>A new application must  be submitted for each eligibility period as you need to attest you were unable  to work.</p>

    <h2 id="taxation">Taxation </h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What does “income tax  withheld at source” mean? </summary>
      <p>“Income tax withheld at source” means that some of the $500 benefit amount  will be withheld by the Canada Revenue Agency before you get your payment,  which will be credited against any income tax you need to pay for the year.</p>
      <p>This helps avoid a large unexpected tax bill at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>No such deductions at source were applied to the CERB, to ensure that  Canadians who required support received the maximum amount when they needed  it.  Individuals will still need to  include the CERB payments they received on their 2020 tax returns, and could be  subject to tax, depending on their overall income for the year.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How will you decide  my tax rate? </summary>
      <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will apply a flat 10% deduction at source for  the Recovery Benefits.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What should I expect when I file my taxes for 2020?</summary>
      <p>Both the CERB and the Recovery Benefits are taxable. At the end of the year, the Canada Revenue Agency will calculate the amount of tax you owe based on your total income including both the amounts received for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Recovery Benefit. </p>
      <p>With respect to the clawback for the Canada Recovery Benefit, you will be required to repay $0.50 of the Benefit for every dollar in net income you earn above $38,000 (excluding the amount received for the Canada Recovery Benefit) to a maximum repayment of the Canada Recovery Benefit received in the year. Amounts repaid will not be included in your taxable income. This will be reconciled on your T1 tax return and the repayment will be incorporated in your total payable. </p>

    <details>
      <summary>How  is eligibility being changed for the 3 recovery benefits?</summary>
      <p>The 3 Canada Recovery Benefits were created to provide  income support to eligible workers who are unable to work for COVID-19 reasons.  They were never intended to provide support to Canadians who travel  internationally and are then required to quarantine as a result.</p>
      <p>The Government of Canada has changed eligibility rules so that international travelers who are required to quarantine upon their return to Canada will not be eligible to receive the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit or the Canada Recovery Benefit during the period of their quarantine.   These changes are retroactive to  October 2, 2020.</p>
      <p>Once they have  served the mandatory quarantine period, individuals would be able to claim the  recovery benefits for subsequent periods if they meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How  will the Government know I am in a mandatory quarantine period?</summary>
      <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) updated the application process for the 3 recovery benefits on Monday, January 11. For claims covering a period beginning on or after October 2, 2020, applicants will need to indicate whether they were self-isolating or in quarantine due to international travel. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>When  does this change come into effect?</summary>
      <p>The   legislation to amend the <em>Canada Recovery Benefits Act</em> came into effect retroactively on October 2, 2020. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How  do I know if I have to quarantine and am impacted by these changes?</summary>
      <p>These changes apply to all international travelers who, on or after October 2, 2020, are required to quarantine when they return to Canada. </p>
      <p>However, you may be eligible for one of the 3 recovery benefits if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you  travelled for medical treatment certified by a medical practitioner </li>
        <li>you  accompanied a person who is incapable of travelling without assistance of an  attendant to receive a medical treatment certified by a medical practitioner</li>
        <li>you are an  essential worker who travelled for reasons normally exempt from quarantine when  you return to Canada (such as health care workers or truck drivers who need to  cross the border for work) but were required to this time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Information on travelers who are required to quarantine and travelers who are exempt can be found here: <a href="/travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation">Mandatory quarantine or isolation</a>.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>I am exempt from the mandatory quarantine, but subsequently fell ill with COVID-19 or had to self-isolate. Am I eligible to claim the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit?</summary>
      <p>If you are exempt from the mandatory quarantine requirements, you may be  eligible to claim the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. You would need to meet  the other eligibility criteria to receive the benefit. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I am exempt from the mandatory quarantine, but subsequently am unable to work  at least 50% of my normally scheduled hours because I have to care for my  children who are required by the government to home school. Am I eligible to  claim the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit?</summary>
      <p>If you are exempt from the mandatory quarantine requirements, you may be  eligible to claim the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit. You would need to  meet the other eligibility criteria to receive the benefit. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I returned from international travel and began serving the mandatory quarantine prior to October 2, 2020. Am I eligible for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit? </summary>
      <p>You are not entitled to the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit for the period of your quarantine that falls after October 2, 2020. However, if you meet the other eligibility criteria, you may be entitled to the benefit during the period of your quarantine that falls before October 2, 2020. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> If I am unable to work due to a COVID-19 reason after my mandatory quarantine  period, will I be able to access the recovery benefits?</summary>
      <p>The eligibility restrictions for international travelers  who need to quarantine only apply for the period during which they have to  quarantine.</p>
      <p>For example, if  a person is unable to work due to COVID-19 after their quarantine period ends  and meets the eligibility criteria for one of the 3 recovery benefits, they  could be eligible to receive that benefit.</p>

      </details>
      <details>

        <p>To be eligible for the Canada Recovery Benefit while still working, you  must have suffered a reduction in average weekly income of at least 50%  relative to pre-pandemic levels. </p>
        <p>A loss of income is defined as a reduction in total average employment  and self-employment income for the 2-week benefit period compared to your  average employment income for a 2-week period the previous year. </p>

        <p>You should talk  to your employer if you are worried about the safety of your  working conditions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you work in a federally-regulated workplace, you may wish to consult your workplace health and safety committee or health and safety representative as well as the document <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/health-safety/reports/right-refuse.html">Right to refuse dangerous work</a></li>
          <li>Otherwise, you may wish to consult the website for the department of labour in your province or territory for further information on your rights and the process  you should follow</li>

        <p>The $5,000 includes all employment and  self-employment income. Employment income includes: tips you have declared as  income; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to  emergency service volunteers); and royalties (e.g., paid to artists). Self-employment  income is revenue from the self-employment less expenses incurred to earn that  revenue.</p>
        <p>You may also include maternity and parental  benefits you received from the Employment Insurance program and/or similar  benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.</p>
        <p>Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not  considered employment income and should not be included.</p>

        <summary>I entered the  labour force late in 2019 so was not able to earn $5,000, but I would have been  able to earn that much in 2020 if I hadn't lost my job due to COVID. Do I  qualify for the Canada Recovery Benefit? </summary>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>To be eligible to receive the Canada Recovery Benefit,  you must have had employment and/or self-employment  income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in 2020, or in the 12-month period prior  to your first application for the CRB. </p>
      </details>

        <summary>If I am in receipt  of dividends, am I eligible for the Canada Recovery Benefit? </summary>
        <p>To be eligible to receive the Canada Recovery Benefit, you must have had employment and/or self-employment  income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in 2020, or in the 12-month period prior  to your first application for the CRB. </p>
        <p>The $5,000 includes all employment and  self-employment income, including non-eligible dividends. </p>
        <p>Non-eligible dividends are generally those paid  out of corporate income taxed at the small business rate. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I am paid income after applying for the Canada Recovery Benefit for work undertaken previously, does it impact my ability to get the Benefit? </summary>
        <p>You may earn income from employment and/or self-employment while receiving the Canada Recovery Benefit, as long as you continue to meet the other  requirements. This includes earning 50% or less of your previous income for a 2-week period due to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>However, you will be required to repay $0.50 of the Benefit for every dollar in net income you earn above $38,000 for the year (excluding the amount  received for the Canada Recovery Benefit). This would include amounts you earned in the year prior to applying for  the Canada Recovery Benefit.</p>

        <p>With respect to the clawback for the Canada Recovery Benefit, you will  be required to repay $0.50 of the Benefit for every dollar in net income you  earn above $38,000 (excluding the amount received for the Canada Recovery  Benefit) to a maximum repayment of the Canada Recovery Benefit received in the  year.

      <h3>Seeking  work </h3>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I prove I  have been seeking work? </summary>
        <p>Consistent with the EI Program, you will be required to attest every 2 weeks that you have been actively looking for work and did not decline  reasonable work opportunities.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What constitutes  “when reasonable”? </summary>
        <p>The Government recognizes that each individual circumstance  is unique. </p>
        <p>Requiring that individuals seek and accept work  when it is reasonable to do so reflects the expectation that individuals return  to work as soon as possible, while allowing them to exercise sound judgement  about their personal safety and that of their families, and the extent to which  the work opportunity reasonably responds to their circumstances.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I was working  full time but can now only find part-time employment at a lower salary, does  that constitute “when reasonable”?  Do I  have to accept the job? </summary>
        <p>The Government recognizes that each individual  circumstance is unique. </p>
        <p>Requiring that individuals seek and accept work  when it is reasonable to do so reflects the expectation that individuals return  to work as soon as possible, while allowing them to exercise sound judgement  about their personal safety and that of their families, and the extent to which  the work opportunity reasonably responds to their circumstances. </p>
        <p>For example, accepting part-time work may be reasonable if it is with  your previous employer at the same or similar pay, with the possibility to work  more hours in the future. However, if the part-time work is not related to your  skill set and offers a much lower salary, you could have reasonable grounds to  refuse it.</p>
        <p>The Canada Recovery Benefit is also available to individuals who have  had at least a 50% reduction in income due to COVID-19, which means even if you accept a job with a  lower salary you may still be eligible for the Benefit.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>My employer has  promised to hire me back as soon as they are able. Do I have to look for and  accept other work, knowing that I have a guaranteed job? </summary>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for the Canada Recovery Benefit, you will be required to  attest every 2 weeks that you are actively seeking work and did not decline reasonable work.</p>
        <p>However, there could be circumstances where you could have reasonable  grounds to turn down work. For example, if your previous employer has made you  a firm offer to return to work in the near future (e.g., within a few weeks),  you may have reasonable grounds to refuse other work offers.</p>

      <h3>Clawback </h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What constitutes  the $38,000 in net income I am allowed to earn before I become subject to the  repayment requirement? </summary>
        <p>You are allowed to earn up to $38,000 in net income (excluding the  amount received for the Canada Recovery Benefit), before becoming subject to  the repayment provision. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What do you mean by net income?  What does this include? </summary>
        <p>Net income refers  to your income as identified on line 23600 of your income tax and benefit  return.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of  the Canada Recovery Benefit this includes all income earned from any source for  which you would pay income tax, with the exception of benefits received for the  Canada Recovery Benefit, payments from a registered disability plan, money  received for the Canada Child Benefit and GST/HST credit.</p>
        <p>Further information  on non-taxable amounts as income can be found <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/amounts-that-taxed.html">online.</a></p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What happens if I have  net income over $38,000 in the tax year?   How will the clawback of Canada Recovery Benefits occur? </summary>
        <p>Individuals who receive the Canada Recovery  Benefit will need to repay some or all of the benefit through their income tax  return if their annual net income, excluding the Canada Recovery Benefit  payment, is over $38,000. In other words, you would need to repay $0.50 of the Benefit  for each dollar of your annual net income above $38,000 in the calendar year to  a maximum of the amount of benefit you received.</p>
        <p>This will be reconciled when you file your taxes for that calendar year.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How will the  clawback be calculated if I collect the Canada Recovery Benefit beginning in  2020 into 2021 (a new calendar year)?  Do  I get to earn up to $38,000 twice – once per calendar year? </summary>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>You can receive net income up to $38,000 in  each calendar year (excluding the amount received for the Canada Recovery  Benefit) before you will be subject to repayment of the Canada Recovery Benefit  for that same year. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How will the  clawback be calculated if I am self-employed and do not draw income from my  business but rather rely on dividends? </summary>
        <p>The Canada Recovery Benefit repayment will kick  in when your net income for the year (excluding Canada Recovery Benefit  payments) is more than $38,000 for the year in which the benefits were  received. </p>
        <p>Taxable dividend amounts received in the year  will be included in determining if the recipient's net income exceeds this  threshold.</p>

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>For how many weeks  can I receive the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit? </summary>
        <p>The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is available for a maximum of 4 weeks within the period from September 27, 2020 to September 25, 2021.</p>
        <p>The Benefit may be taken in 4 one-week periods.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I have to use up  any other sick leave I have before I can apply for the Canada Recovery Sickness  Benefit? </summary>

      <details>
        <summary>Why is the Sickness  benefit restricted only to COVID-related sick leave? </summary>
        <p>The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is available to ensure that eligible workers who are unable to work because they are sick, under quarantine, must self-isolate due to COVID-19 or are more susceptible to COVID-19 due to an underlying condition, have access to up to 4 weeks of income support so that they can take time off from work and avoid putting themselves or others in the community at risk. This delivers on the Government of Canada’s commitment as part of the Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories.</p>
        <p>In addition to the availability of the  Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, through temporary changes to the Employment  Insurance program, workers will require only 120 hours of insurable employment  to qualify for EI sickness benefits between September 27, 2020 and September  25, 2021.

        <p>The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is available for up to 4 weeks, which may be taken in 4 one-week periods between September 27, 2020 and September 25, 2021.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Am I eligible for  the Benefit if I have to self-isolate but am able to work from home? </summary>
        <p>No. </p>
        <p>To  be eligible for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, you must have a minimum 50%  reduction in scheduled work per week as a result of illness and/or quarantine  related to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>If  you are able to work from home for more than 50% of your scheduled work per  week you will not be eligible. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I  receive the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit if I <u>choose</u> to stay home to  avoid catching COVID-19 but was not advised to do so by a medical professional? </summary>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>You are eligible for up to 4 weeks of the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit if you are either sick with COVID-19, have been directed to self-quarantine by your employer, a medical practitioner, a nurse practitioner, a person in authority, a government or a public health authority for reasons related to COVID-19, or have underlying conditions that in the opinion of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, person in authority, government or public health authority would make you more susceptible to COVID-19</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I am advised by  person in authority to stay home to avoid catching COVID-19, can I receive the Canada Recovery Sickness  Benefit? </summary>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>You are eligible for up to 4 weeks of the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit if you are either sick with COVID-19, have been directed to self-quarantine by your employer, a medical practitioner, a nurse practitioner, a person in authority, a government or a public health authority for reasons related to COVID-19, or have underlying conditions that in the opinion of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, person in authority, government or public health authority would make you more susceptible to COVID-19</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I already received CRSB for 2 weeks in the fall of 2020, the maximum number of weeks available at that time. I was also sick for a week due to COVID at the end of January 2021. Can I apply retroactively?</summary>
        <p>Yes, but you must apply for that week within 60 days from the beginning of the last week in which you were working and stopped working due to COVID-19.  Effective March 15, 2021, the maximum number of weeks that can be claimed under the CRSB has increased from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Retroactive applications within 60 days can be requested on the CRSB website.</p>

      <h3>Access </h3>
      <details>
        <summary>Am I required to  provide a doctor's note to access the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit? </summary>
        <p>No. </p>
        <p>You are not required to have a medical  certificate to qualify for the benefit, as long as you meet all eligibility  criteria.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I work shift  work, how do I calculate the 50% reduction in my work week? </summary>
        <p>To qualify for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, you must be unable  to work at least 50% of their normal work schedule because you are sick,  quarantined or have been directed to self-isolate  due to COVID-19. </p>
        <p>For example, if you normally work 35  hours per week, you would be eligible if you can only work 17.5 or fewer hours.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why do I have to  use a full week's worth of Benefit if I am only required to isolate myself for 2 or 3 days, for example while waiting for test results? </summary>
        <p>The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is a temporary income support  program to enable workers to stay home if they are unable to work because they  are sick or potentially exposed to COVID-19 or at greater risk if exposed to  COVID-19.  The Government has put the  emphasis on providing quick and direct access, which has required a simplified  approach to delivery of the benefit.  As a result, it is not possible to provide  the benefit for periods of less than a week. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If I am sick for  reasons related to COVID-19, should I apply for the Canada Recovery Sickness  Benefit or Employment Insurance (EI) Sickness benefits? </summary>
        <p>If you are sick or must self-isolate due to COVID-19 and are eligible for  both Employment Insurance sickness benefits and the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit,  you can choose which benefit you want to claim. </p>
        <p>However, you can't get both EI sickness  benefits and the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit for the same period.</p>
