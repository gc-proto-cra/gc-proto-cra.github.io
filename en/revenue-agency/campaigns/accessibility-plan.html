    <h2 id="h_1">Message from the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner</h2>
<p>We are pleased to share the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) first Accessibility Plan. This plan brings together the CRA's new and ongoing efforts to realize the vision set out by the Accessible Canada Act (the Act), which aims to create a barrier-free Canada by 2040. By delivering upon this vision, the CRA will identify, remove, and prevent barriers in CRA workplaces and in our delivery of program and services to Canadians.</p>
<p>The CRA's People First philosophy, which guides us to meet client and employee needs and expectations by putting people at the centre of everything we do, is fully aligned with the vision set out by the Act. Our philosophy reinforces the importance of engaging people with disabilities to understand their experiences, the issues that they face, and how we can improve our services to align with their needs. We strive to be trusted, fair, and helpful by putting people first so that Canadians feel seen, heard, and responded to according to their diverse needs and perspectives. Accessibility is essential to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Our commitment to this Plan acknowledges that there are over 15 million Canadians with a disability, and this number is growing. We recognize that we have work to do to ensure that our workplaces, programs and services are barrier free and accessible to all. In the delivery of this and future Accessibility Plans, the CRA will ensure that it considers the intersectionality across the diverse experiences, circumstances, and situations that shape our clients' and employees' lived experiences. To do this, the Agency will continue to create opportunities to hear the voices of, and closely consult with, employees and persons with disabilities as part of our work to fulfill our legislative obligations under the Act, and more importantly, it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The CRA's Accessibility Plan lists concrete actions that we will undertake to implement solutions to identified accessibility barriers. We will make regular Progress Reports that describes how we are implementing our Accessibility Plan, and how we are responding to the feedback we have and will continue to receive from those with lived experience.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, we will take decisive steps towards becoming truly barrier-free. We are adopting an accessible-by-design approach to help shape the necessary changes to our programs and services. In the meantime, we invite you to share your thoughts with us on the Plan – information on how to do so can be found in the next section.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with you to take accessibility at the CRA to a higher level.</p>

    <h2 id="h_3">2. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>As part of the commitments set out in the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada/act-summary.html">Accessible Canada Act</a> and with a goal of making Canada barrier-free by <span class="nowrap">January 1, 2040,</span> the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is proud to present its first Accessibility Plan, which runs from 2023 to 2025.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Plan sets out the CRA’s approach to identifying, removing, and preventing accessibility barriers over the next three years. It also outlines the CRA’s accountability and governance approach to delivering upon the Act, as well as the importance of preserving accessibility while transitioning to a hybrid work model. Further, the Plan conveys the need for an organizational culture that supports accessibility and inclusion. We recognize that employees must be fully equipped and supported to deliver accessible services to all clients.</p>
<p>Our Accessibility Plan is grounded in the principle of “Nothing Without Us,” and is shaped by consultations with persons with disabilities, interviews with organizations that support them, and engagements with CRA employees with disabilities. Program and service areas within the CRA, the CRA’s Board of Management, the Disability Advisory Committee, and the External Advisory Panel on Service were also engaged. As well, the CRA looked at data from surveys, research, and insights shared by other government departments.</p>
<p>We identified four areas of focus for our Accessibility Plan:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Building expertise, understanding, and respect and reducing the stigma related to accessibility and persons with disabilities.</li>
 <li>Increasing options and flexibility for tailored approaches to increase and improve access to our programs and services.</li>
 <li>Ensuring our written products are accessible and use accessible language.</li>
 <li>Capturing and actioning feedback to continually learn and improve in the above noted and other areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most importantly, the Accessibility Plan lists key accessibility barriers that CRA clients and employees with disabilities are facing, and the actions we will take to address them. These barriers and actions are sorted by the seven areas in the Accessible Canada Act:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The employment section specifies the actions we will take to improve how we recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities.</li>
 <li>The built environment section covers actions to improve accessibility in all CRA-occupied buildings, including how employees use physical workspaces and how members of the public are able to access CRA-occupied sites.</li>
 <li>The information and communication technologies (ICT) section outlines how the CRA will work towards creating a barrier-free, digital, accessible environment that all CRA employees and clients can use.</li>
 <li>The section on communications other than ICT identifies the actions that we will take to address barriers related to plain language, public communications, and the availability of diverse communications options.</li>
 <li>The procurement of goods, services, and facilities section shows how we will address barriers relating to acquiring and buying goods, services, or other items.</li>
 <li>The section on the design and delivery of programs and services identifies actions to remove barriers and make programs and services more accessible.</li>
 <li>The section on transportation explains how the CRA will improve the accessibility of the vehicles it owns, leases, or rents.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional list of barriers and actions related to training and learning has also been included in the Plan. Persons with disabilities identified these as important areas where the CRA could improve. Learning from the knowledge, expertise, and experiences of persons with disabilities is essential to helping us ensure we are fully capable of delivering barrier-free services to all our clients.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">3. Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency is fully committed to the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada/act-summary.html">Accessible Canada Act</a> (the Act)'s goal of making Canada barrier-free by <span class="nowrap">January 1, 2040.</span> Accessibility is a fundamental part of client and employee experience, and strengthening accessibility across our programs, services, and policies is what we aim to achieve through this Accessibility Plan.</p>
<p>The Act was enacted in July 2019, cementing the Government of Canada's commitment to proactively identify, remove, and prevent barriers to accessibility where Canadians interact with areas under federal responsibility; whether they be internal or external to an organization. Through the Act, federal departments and agencies have been assigned three important requirements to support accessibility:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Creating three-year Accessibility Plans that set out how they will identify, remove, and prevent barriers to accessibility in programs and services.</li>
 <li>Publishing annual Progress Reports that describe how organizations are delivering upon their Accessibility Plans.</li>
 <li>Implementing processes to collect, manage, and respond to feedback on accessibility, including Accessibility Plans and Progress Reports.</li>
</ol>
<p>These activities must be done in consultation with persons with disabilities, respecting the principle of "Nothing Without Us". Through regular consultation with persons with disabilities, the CRA is ensuring that its activities are directly aligned with the needs and expectations of those with lived experience. This also means engaging persons with disabilities to identify accessibility barriers, shape the work that is being done to address these barriers, and ensure that these efforts are effective in creating more positive outcomes. While the Act has introduced new requirements for organizations to follow, ensuring that experiences are accessible is more than a legislative obligation, it is simply the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The CRA's People First philosophy is reflected in its Accessibility Plan, which sets out the Agency's approach to addressing accessibility barriers over the next three years – focusing on the seven areas listed in the Act:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Employment;</li>
 <li>The built environment (buildings and public spaces);</li>
 <li>Information and communication technologies;</li>
 <li>Communication, other than information and communication technologies;</li>
 <li>The procurement of goods, services and facilities;</li>
 <li>The design and delivery of programs and services; and,</li>
 <li>Transportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Agency also recognizes that to deliver accessible programs and services, it needs the right organizational culture: one that puts accessibility and inclusion at the forefront of all that it does. This is why a section has been included in the Plan on organizational culture and change management, as it is vital that managers and employees are fully equipped and supported to offer accessible services for all clients.</p>
<p>The CRA is committed to ensuring that its programs, services and workplace are accessible to all. Over the coming weeks, months, and years, the CRA commits to remove and prevent barriers to accessibility, upholding the rights of persons with disabilities under the Act, and working with persons with disabilities to strengthen the accessibility of all that it does.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
 <p><strong>Important note</strong>: While the barriers in this Accessibility Plan have been numbered for ease of reference, the numbers used do not reflect the level of priority assigned to barriers and their respective actions.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_5">4. Consultations</h2>
<p>The CRA's Accessibility Plan has been shaped by consultations with persons with disabilities, interviews with organizations that support them, and engagements with CRA employees with disabilities. Through this research, key drivers were identified that informed what barriers the CRA chose to target in the Plan, as well as the proposed actions to remove and prevent them.</p>
<p>In Fall 2021, the CRA <strong>carried out an initial review of the state of accessibility</strong> for its external programs and services. This environmental scan complemented existing research on the state of internal services for employees. It found gaps related to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Accessibility knowledge and expertise at the CRA;</li>
 <li>Inaccessible language, procedures, and processes, and;</li>
 <li>Limited opportunities for clients or employees to provide accessibility feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>From November 2021 to January 2022, the CRA <strong>interviewed representatives from community organizations</strong> from across Canada who help persons with disabilities access programs and services, to seek their perspectives on their experiences supporting clients with disabilities. These interviews provided valuable information on:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>The social context of disability</strong>, which is important in understanding how persons with disabilities interact with the CRA. For example, low income levels lead to barriers related to access to technology, assistive devices, and costs for accessing programs and services. Isolation can worsen accessibility barriers for people who need support to file taxes and access benefits, particularly for those in northern or rural areas. Finally, social stigmas associated with disability can be a barrier to receiving needed support, as some people are reluctant to self-identify.</li>
 <li><strong>The diverse needs and experiences of persons with disabilities</strong>, which makes different service options more or less accessible to different people. For example, many clients prefer to interact with the CRA over the phone because it requires less mobility and dexterity than online services. On the other hand, others face accessibility barriers related to phone services, such as difficulties with authentication. Others still may find navigating websites difficult because information is not always presented in plain language, and too much information is presented at once.</li>
 <li><strong>The varied experiences of persons with disabilities engaging with the Canadian tax and benefit system</strong>. Some persons with disabilities file their taxes and apply for benefits independently with ease, others complete these tasks with the support of an intermediary and/or with disability accommodations, and others do not do them at all. Challenges that limit persons with disabilities from filing or applying independently, or sometimes at all, include limited access to technology, long and complex application forms, challenges in obtaining and retaining the needed documents, and fees associated with filling out forms or other professional assistance required when applying for these programs.</li>
 <li><strong>Ways in which participants felt the CRA could improve the accessibility of its programs and services</strong>, including expanding the CRA's service channel options to include video chat, text-based chat, a dedicated phone line, or in-person service. Other suggestions focused on making the CRA's approach to interacting with persons with disabilities more adaptable, such as by allowing alternative forms of authentication over the phone, a call back option to avoid waiting on the line, or giving caregivers and other trusted third parties more options to support their clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In April and May 2022, the CRA held a <strong>national public consultation exercise for persons with disabilities and caregivers</strong> to share their experiences with the CRA, the accessibility barriers that they have found, and what could be done to address them. Participants took part in discussion groups, one-on-one interviews, or by completing an online survey. <strong>The input shared by participants can be categorized into three themes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Awareness and Respect</strong>: Participants highlighted the importance of being respected, understood in an inclusive environment when interacting with the CRA. While this does happen in many cases, some clients said that there are examples where their issues are not fully resolved. Barriers that clients have experienced related to this theme include:
 <ul>
 <li>Feeling rushed to complete a task;</li>
 <li>CRA agents speaking too quickly, not speaking clearly or loudly, or using complex language;</li>
 <li>Being ignored or asked to complete tasks they are unable to do;</li>
 <li>Being passed around from agent to agent;</li>
 <li>Not having requested accommodations provided, and;</li>
 <li>CRA agents not accepting a caregiver, interpreter, or intervener as a representative who is supporting communication for a client.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Accessing Information</strong>: Individuals who took part in the consultations raised concerns about barriers to accessing information from the CRA, whether it be by website, phone, or mail. These included:
 <ul>
 <li>Information not being shared in American Sign Language (ASL) or langue des signes québécoise (LSQ); and</li>
 <li>Text being too long and/or complex, which is inaccessible to persons with cognitive disabilities or those who use ASL or LSQ as their primary language.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Having More Options for Interaction</strong>: For many people with disabilities, their communication needs and preferred channels often change from day to day, based on their situation and the nature of their disability. Participants expressed that their individual needs and situations require an individualized approach. Many participants indicated that being provided with options, and not being "forced online," would go a long way to show that the CRA is committed to a client-centered approach, rather than feeling that they have to communicate in the way that best suits the CRA.</li>
</ul>
<p>In August 2022, CRA <strong>employees with disabilities were invited to provide their feedback</strong> on the first draft of the Accessibility Plan. In that consultation, employees shared that:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Culture change is crucial for making the CRA an accessible organization and eliminating barriers for persons with disabilities.</li>
 <li>Persons with disabilities should be meaningfully involved with each aspect of this ongoing move towards a fully accessible Agency.</li>
 <li>Education is key to creating an accessibility-positive culture at the CRA, and learning about disability should be incorporated into the learning plans of employees.</li>
 <li>All tools, websites, letters and other communications (internal and external) must be written in plain language.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the identification of barriers and solutions, the CRA also consulted program and service areas, the CRA's Disability Advisory Committee, and the External Advisory Panel on Service. In addition, the Agency studied data from surveys, research, and other information shared by government departments. <strong>Through these activities, the CRA has identified four areas of focus for its Accessibility Plan</strong>:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Building expertise, understanding, respect and reducing stigma related to accessibility and persons with disabilities.</li>
 <li>Increasing options and flexibility for tailored approaches to increase and improve access to CRA programs and services.</li>
 <li>Ensuring CRA written products are accessible and use accessible language.</li>
 <li>Capturing and actioning feedback to continually learn about and improve the accessibility of Agency programs and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="#h_10">Annex B</a> for more information on who was consulted as part of the development of the CRA's Accessibility Plan and the methods of consultation.</p>
<h2 id="h_6">5. Building on the Foundation of Accessibility at the CRA</h2>

<p>The CRA has been actively working to better understand the implications of the Act, identify barriers to accessibility, and seek solutions with the input of persons with disabilities to eliminate these barriers. Part of this work includes putting in place the appropriate internal structures, mechanisms, and strategies to help us succeed in meeting the requirements of the Act. With this in mind, the CRA recognizes that it must establish the right governance, accountability framework, and organizational culture to promote accessibility – all while supporting its employees through the resulting organizational change.</p>
<h3 id="h_6_1">5.1 Accountability and Governance</h3>
<p>To guide the delivery of the Act within the Agency, the CRA created an Accessibility Centre of Expertise and Agency Secretariat (ACEAS). The ACEAS will work within the CRA to help its various branches and regions fulfill their legislative obligations under the Act and foster collaboration on accessibility across the CRA's services. To carry out this work, ACEAS engages persons with disabilities to ensure that their lived experiences shape the CRA's strategic direction for accessibility.</p>
<p>The ACEAS is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>writing the CRA's Accessibility Plans and Progress Reports;</li>
 <li>ensuring that feedback mechanisms on accessibility are in place and that clients' feedback on accessibility is used to inform program and service delivery;</li>
 <li>consulting with employees and the public on Accessibility Plans, Progress Reports, and other emerging issues related to the delivery of the Act;</li>
 <li>providing advice and guidance on accessibility, with the goal of building expertise across the Agency and integrating accessibility in all that we do; and,</li>
 <li>working with stakeholders and other government departments to share information, best practices, and lessons learned on delivering barrier-free services for Canadians.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA's Persons with Disabilities Network (the Network) also plays an important role in shaping accessibility at the Agency. The Network is made up of employees with disabilities that have lived experience with accessibility barriers, have insights and experiences to share in helping remove barriers, and are also taxpayers themselves. The ACEAS relies on the Network to share the perspectives of CRA employees with disabilities and involves the Network throughout the development of the CRA's Accessibility Plans.</p>
<p>To further strengthen our commitment to accessibility, <strong>the CRA will take the following actions</strong> to put in place a strong governance and accountability structure for accessibility:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Establish a senior executive sponsor for accessibility in the CRA.
 <ul>
 <li>As an agent for change, the sponsor will influence decision-making, engage colleagues to achieve accessibility objectives, and mobilize resources to ensure that accessibility is at the core of management and decision-making.</li>
 <li>This role will be held by the Assistant Commissioner of the Service, Innovation and Integration Branch.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Embed accessibility requirements into policy review mechanisms so that all future reviews of CRA policies, directives, programs, service delivery channels, and operational procedures are in line with the Act.</li>
 <li>Incorporate accessibility into our planning, decision-making, and implementation processes, such as in our major project investments.</li>
 <li>Develop a feedback mechanism to collect internal feedback on accessibility and strengthen existing external feedback channels.</li>
 <li>Allocate the funding to deliver on the commitments in this plan and establish a permanent capacity to oversee the CRA's Accessibility programme.</li>
 <li>Develop a performance measurement framework for accessibility to measure and report on CRA's progress in removing barriers.
 <ul>
 <li>Success will be measured by CRA's ability to improve access to programs and services (internally and externally) as well as the experience of CRA's clients and employees with disabilities in their interactions with the Agency, using a tailored client-centric approach.</li>
 <li>Success will also be measured in the CRA's ability to foster a high-performing, diverse, and inclusive workforce in a modern, flexible and accessible workplace.</li>
 <li>Progress will be evaluated using many data sources, including consultations with persons with disabilities, the Public Service Employee Survey, and the CRA's Annual Corporate Research.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_6_2">5.2 Accessibility and the CRA's Transition Plan</h3>
<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, CRA employees have navigated through significant changes in their home and work environments to deliver CRA programs, with many CRA employees continuing to perform their duties remotely. Employee experiences, including those of our employees with disabilities, are helping to shape the CRA's transition towards a flexible, digital, hybrid model of working that will enable the CRA to continue delivering on our mandate to Canadians.</p>
<p>Through consultations with employees with disabilities, the CRA learned that the hybrid model should not be a one-size-fits-all solution; it must be flexible so that it can take into account the specific needs of individuals and help address some of the accessibility barriers identified in this Plan. The Agency will continue to engage persons with disabilities and other stakeholders to identify, remove, and prevent accessibility barriers in the hybrid work environment, including those related to physical barriers (such as those related to physical access and mobility, emergency procedures, accessible washrooms, ergonomic requirements), allergy and sensory issues (sound, smell, light levels), technological barriers (such as availability of assistive technologies, and use of accessible software), and cognitive, mental-health and other related concerns.</p>
<p>Monitoring and measuring success of the hybrid model's impact on accessibility and the working experience of employees with disabilities is important and will help identify opportunities to eliminate barriers that persist for employees. To measure the success of our hybrid work model, the CRA is developing a performance measurement framework to assess our success in achieving outcomes and to flag areas that may require attention. We will also use pulse surveys and analyze current and future Public Service Employee Survey results to gather information and input on workplace accessibility factors.</p>
<h3 id="h_6_3">5.3 Building an Organizational Culture that Promotes Accessibility</h3>
<p>In consultations with persons with disabilities, the Agency identified the need to address significant cultural accessibility barriers. These include individual biases, stigmas, assumptions, and discrimination which continue to shape the experiences and treatment of employees and clients who identify as persons with disabilities. A workforce that is empathetic, educated and aware of the rights of persons with disabilities to receive accessible internal and external programs and services is not optional or "nice to have". It is a foundational requirement of ensuring the CRA can meet its obligations under the Act.</p>
<p>Building an organizational culture that promotes inclusiveness and accessibility will take time. Communications, awareness-raising tools and training will be crucial to creating a more inclusive workplace and a culture of accessibility. <strong>With this in mind, the CRA, in consultation with persons with disabilities, will</strong>:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Increase internal awareness about accessibility by developing and putting a communications plan in place to inform employees of our progress in identifying, addressing, and removing accessibility barriers. Build momentum, employee interest and engagement in the implementation of this plan by highlighting and celebrating our progress as an Agency in removing barriers.</li>
 <li>Use various communication channels and tactics to increase employee understanding of disability and accessibility, including the rights of persons with disabilities, including invisible and episodic disabilities, and appropriate language around disability.</li>
 <li>Develop awareness initiatives and hold accessibility and inclusion-themed events for employees, managers, and executives, and create intranet content that highlights key accessibility themes and employee experiences.</li>
 <li>Provide awareness and training opportunities particularly targeted to the manager and executive communities. The aim will be to increase awareness of employer responsibilities with respect to providing supports, resources and accommodations, as applicable, for employees with disabilities, encourage self-reflection and build strong leadership in the Agency on accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Change management is also an essential part of shifting any organization's culture, by focusing on the adoption of the changes that the CRA is committing to bring about in this plan. Change management uses processes, tools, and best practices to lead people through change. It recognizes that organizations don't change, people do, and it uses a structured and holistic approach to drive individual change to achieve organizational change.</p>
<p>The CRA will anchor the change management process in the "Nothing Without Us" principle, by continually consulting with persons with disabilities to help us develop and put in place services that are accessible by default and by design. Further, in line with the CRA's People First philosophy, the Agency will focus on supporting our employees to adopt new organizational attitudes, behaviours, and competencies related to disability and accessibility. We will build and reinforce new habits to ensure all CRA employees are onboard to champion and adopt the change and build a strong culture that supports accessibility in all seven areas of the Act.</p>
<h2 id="h_7">6. Areas under the Accessible Canada Act</h2>
<p>The CRA recognizes that identifying, removing, and preventing accessibility barriers is essential to a future of inclusion and fairness. In this spirit, our accessibility plans represent an ongoing commitment to consult, listen, take responsibility, and remove accessibility barriers wherever we find them.</p>
<p>This section specifies the barriers (and our commitments to address them) we identified through research and consultation as those that are of greatest importance to our internal and external clients. While we work to address these barriers, we will remain committed to identifying and addressing new barriers over the next three years.</p>
<p>The barriers and actions included in this Accessibility Plan were developed by directly consulting:</p>
<ul>
 <li>persons with disabilities;</li>
 <li>CRA employees with disabilities (including the Persons with Disabilities Network);</li>
 <li>subject matter experts;</li>
 <li>service organizations who support persons with disabilities;</li>
 <li>colleagues in other government departments, and;</li>
 <li>members of the general public with an interest in creating an accessible Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue to engage these partners (and others) to learn about new accessibility barriers, we will also act to address them – whether they are included in our Accessibility Plan or not.</p>
<h3 id="h_7_1">6.1 Employment</h3>
<p>Actions under the <strong>Employment</strong> section will improve recruitment, retention, and promotion of persons with visible and non-visible disabilities. Through the CRA Persons with Disabilities Network and in public consultations, we learned that issues around professional development, promotion, and retention were of particular concern to persons with disabilities. The barriers targeted below represent the first steps toward closing these gaps.</p>

<details>
    <summary>
Barrier 1: Recruitment activities often overlook accessibility and disability inclusion. Among CRA representatives involved in recruitment activities, some lack awareness about how to connect with and recruit persons with disabilities.
</summary>
    <div class="tgl-panel">
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 1</strong></p>
<p>We will look to remove this barrier by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>offering prospective candidates with disabilities more inclusive recruitment activities to encourage them to consider us as an employer of choice;</li>
 <li>working with universities to host events specifically for persons with disabilities during the academic year;</li>
 <li>promoting accommodations measures available to prospective candidates;</li>
 <li>raising the awareness of our representatives to improve their effectiveness in recruiting persons with disabilities;</li>
 <li>working with on-site management services to provide accommodations for candidates during in-person events; and,</li>
 <li>promoting career progression opportunities targeted to persons with disabilities.</li>

<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 2</strong></p>
<p>We will deliver on and update yearly a Strategy for Recruitment, Onboarding, and Retention of Persons with Disabilities, which will include initiatives to address recruitment barriers, initiatives to improve retention and promotion of employees with disabilities, and ways to measure progress in strengthening these areas.</p>
<p>Targets and initiatives in the Strategy include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>750 net new persons with disabilities are hired by the CRA by 2025; and</li>
 <li>identify and remove employment barriers for job seekers and employees with disabilities through the pilot of a CRA Career Centre for persons with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>Strategy Published – October 2022</li>

Barrier 3: The process to accommodate for injury, illness, medical condition, or disability is said to be complex and lengthy, and there is a lack of awareness of the support available for employees and their managers during the accommodation process.
</summary>
    <div class="tgl-panel">
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 3</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to build awareness in employees and managers by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>working with providers to ensure that they comply with our accessibility technology requirements (for example, adaptive technology);</li>
 <li>developing additional support tools where needed as we evolve for the workplace of the future;</li>
 <li>promoting the Informal Conflict Resolution (ICR) Program and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to support employees as they are dealing with change related to an accommodation plan or a solution;</li>
 <li>identifying and putting methods in place to reduce response time for requests for accommodation due to injury, illness, medical condition, or disability;</li>
 <li>reviewing and creating efficiencies, whenever possible, for workplace accommodations;</li>
 <li>review the process for employees to obtain adaptive technology in order to find efficiencies and reduce wait times for employees to be accommodated; and,</li>
 <li>perform a needs analysis to determine the need for potential increase of the procurement and inventory of adaptive technology solutions to support new and existing employees requiring adaptive technology accommodations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing, with progress and results reported yearly, over the three year cycle covered by this plan, to demonstrate improved engagement with persons with disabilities and improved response to requests for accommodations.</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 4</strong></p>
<p>We will implement best practices in assessment accommodations by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>developing content on assessment accommodations for our public web pages to increase awareness and understanding;</li>
 <li>promoting the use of inclusive language, accessible documents, and universal design in assessments;</li>
 <li>learning from best practices related to assessment accommodations and further expanding guidelines for administering tests; and,</li>
 <li>identifying how our assessment accommodation process could use the Government of Canada Accessibility Passport.</li>

Barrier 4: Accommodation needs are not following employees from position to position.
</summary>
    <div class="tgl-panel">
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 6</strong></p>
<p>To close this gap, we will affirm that accommodation, when possible, follows an employee without them having to resubmit an accommodation request. When they move to a new team or position, their supervisor will review their existing accommodation needs against the new job duties and will ensure the appropriate accommodation measures are put in place.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> March 2023</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 7</strong></p>
<p>We will determine how to integrate the concept of the Government of Canada Accessibility Passport in our process for accommodating injury, illness, medical condition, or disability. We will do this by considering the existing individual accommodation plan we use in our process. Both tools can move with an employee to another position within the CRA or another department and can be used to start the conversation about accommodation needs.</p>

<h3 id="h_7_2">6.2 The built environment</h3>
<p>The <strong>built environment</strong> refers to all CRA-occupied buildings, including how employees use physical workspaces and how the public accesses these buildings when needed. We are working with the CRA Persons with Disabilities Network to improve the accessibility of the built environment with an "inclusive by design" and "accessible by default" approach. Further, we will also ensure that the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with disabilities is factored into this work.</p>
<details>
    <summary>
Barrier 6: Although all CRA buildings have been fit-up to meet barrier-free building codes, not all CRA buildings are fully accessible since the codes are a minimum requirement. This creates barriers when moving through the work space, accessing the building, and interacting within the space.
</summary>
    <div class="tgl-panel">
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 9</strong></p>
<p>To meet the goals of the Act, we will evaluate the built environment to ensure that it meets accessibility standards as defined by Accessible Standards Canada. We will also look to determine where we can make accessibility enhancements in all our spaces and how the built environment can positively affect the workplace of the future. We will do this by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>consulting continually with the CRA's Persons with Disabilities Network; and,</li>
 <li>working on short, medium, and long-term initiatives with Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) as our service provider.

 <li>re-evaluating lighting;</li>
 <li>Installing way-finding systems and signage components, such as QR codes, NFC tags, and Braille signage;</li>
 <li>installing sensory elements, including visual alarms for employees with hearing disabilities (such as strobe lights); and,</li>
 <li>For new projects, review how to improve circulation space for employees with mobility disabilities (more circulation space surrounding tables in meeting rooms, widths of corridors, and aisles etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The examination, analysis, and alignment with the PSPC strategy will be completed and a planned approach for accessibility enhancements in line with PSPC will be in place.</p>

<h2 id="h_8">7. Training and Learning on Accessibility</h2>
<p>Through internal and external engagement and consultations with persons with disabilities, the CRA has learned that building awareness and knowledge around providing accessible and inclusive services for persons with disabilities is a key area that needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Learning from the knowledge, expertise, and experiences of persons with disabilities is essential to ensure we are fully capable of delivering barrier-free, fair, helpful and respectful services to all Canadians. We are committed to reviewing the training and tools we give to internal and external client-serving employees as part of the implementation of this plan. As well, we will review our ongoing training requirements on our policies, directives, tools, and technologies. Training and learning for employees, managers and executives will be key in creating a culture of accessibility and a move towards accessibility by default.</p>
<p>This gap in knowledge and expertise in accessibility has led to the identification of another barrier, along with three Agency-wide deliverables to make significant strides in this area.</p>
<details>
    <summary>
Barrier 23: Insufficient training for CRA employees, managers and executives on how to design and provide barrier-free internal and external services.
</summary>
    <div class="tgl-panel">
    <p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 38</strong></p>
    <p>We recognize how important it is to make sure that taxpayers and employees with disabilities feel respected, understood, and welcomed. We will improve the service provided to persons with disabilities by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Identifying ways to include accessibility awareness training and other specialized training in the learning paths of employees, particularly front-line employees who provide services to the public and those who deliver internal services.</li>
 <li>Using accessible online or group training tools to raise awareness of the lived experiences of those with visible and non-visible disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Products will continually be developed and published during 2023 and 2024</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 39</strong></p>
<p>We will provide all employees with relevant accessibility knowledge and tools to provide services to persons with disabilities, whether they be CRA employees or members of the public. This work will include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ensuring that procedural manuals contain the necessary information or links to information required to guide program officers in treating service feedback received from persons with disabilities;</li>
 <li>Creating an Accessibility Hub, which will house recommended resources for CRA employees in designing and delivering accessible programs and services;</li>
 <li>Creating a specialized training program for compensation centre employees on providing accessible services, co-created with persons with disabilities; and,</li>
 <li>Expanding training offerings related to the Duty to Accommodate for both managers and employees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing with publication dates scheduled for 2023 and 2024</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 40</strong></p>
<p>We will launch resources, tools, and guidance for IT employees on IT accessibility. IT employees will have the resources they need to make internal IT solutions accessible. We will do this by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Promoting IT accessibility guidelines internally to IT employees;</li>
 <li>Providing current and future IT employees with access to IT accessibility training; and,</li>
 <li>Developing a centralized knowledge base to host all IT accessibility knowledge and promote accessibility to ensure that all IT professionals consider accessibility in all phases of the software development lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> September 2023</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 41</strong></p>
<p>We will launch resources, tools, and guidance for our employees on how to create accessible communications such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails. We will equip employees with the resources and information they need to make all communications accessible. We will do this by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Promoting accessibility guidelines internally to all employees;</li>
 <li>Making training and support on creating accessible communications available to all employees; and,</li>
 <li>Updating system defaults to enable accessible functionality whenever possible (for example, using accessible fonts, colours, and closed captioning).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> December 2025</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-0"><strong>Action 42</strong></p>
<p>We will review the existing training offered at the CRA on all topics to assess the degree to which it is accessible and take steps to identify solutions, accommodations or alternatives for training that is not currently accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> December 2023</p>
</div>
  </details>
<p>We know that these deliverables are just a start; the CRA is also considering more training solutions – including on how to better understand the root causes of accessibility issues and how to quickly address them. The Agency will seek out other opportunities for accessibility training and learning, including offering content related to how social factors can influence the experiences that persons with disabilities have with the CRA.</p>
<h2 id="h_9">Annex A - Glossary</h2>
<h3 class="h4">Ableism</h3>
<p>Ableism is a view or attitude that treats people without disabilities as "normal" and those with disabilities as "abnormal," "inferior," or "other." Ableism can be both intentional and unintentional.</p>
<p>Intentional ableism might involve things like:</p>
<ul>
 <li>bullying and ridicule (such as the use of slurs or insults);</li>
 <li>using a person's disability to take advantage or cause harm (such as by putting items in inaccessible places), and;</li>
 <li>treating a person with a disability as if they are incapable or unintelligent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unintentional ableism can be just as harmful. It might involve things like:</p>
<ul>
 <li>creating documents or other materials that look nice but are inaccessible to persons with seeing disabilities;</li>
 <li>planning events where some persons with disabilities cannot participate comfortably or safely, and;</li>
 <li>using words or phrases without thinking about how they can affect persons with disabilities</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">Accessibility Centre of Expertise and Agency Secretariat (ACEAS)</h3>
<p>CRA's ACEAS serves as the central coordinating body for accessibility at the CRA and provides organizational leadership and guidance. The ACEAS works with CRA program and service areas to help them fulfill their legislative obligations under the Act and foster collaboration across the CRA on accessibility in internal and external services.</p>
<p>The ACEAS is responsible for writing the CRA's Accessibility Plans and Progress Reports, ensuring that feedback mechanisms are in place for accessibility, undertaking consultations with employees and the public, and working with other government departments to share information, best practices and lessons learned on delivering barrier-free services for Canadians.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Accommodation</h3>
<p>The process and implementation of changes to a job, tasks, and/or to the environment in which the job is accomplished that enable employees to perform job duties productively, and maximize participation in the workplace. Accommodation options generally fall under three main categories: adjustments to the work schedule, adjustments to the job duties/activities, and adjustment to the work environment.</p>
<p>Sources: Workplace Management – Glossary of Definitions; Employee accommodation process</p>
<h3 class="h4">Assistive or adaptive device/technology</h3>
<p>A device or system designed to help a person to perform a task, including assistive equipment (for example, canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, hearing aids and personal emergency response systems) as well as IT-related items (for example, computer screen-reading software).</p>

<h3 class="h4">Disability type</h3>
<p>A form of limitation, be it physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory or other.</p>
<p>In its 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability, Statistics Canada used screening questions to identify the following 10 types of disability:</p>
<ul>
 <li>seeing</li>
 <li>hearing</li>
 <li>mobility</li>
 <li>flexibility</li>
 <li>dexterity</li>
 <li>pain-related</li>
 <li>learning</li>
 <li>developmental</li>
 <li>mental health-related</li>
 <li>memory</li>
</ul>
<p>The screening questionnaire also contained a question concerning any other health problem or condition that has lasted or is expected to last for six months or more. This question was meant to be a catch-all in case the 10 disability types did not cover the respondent's situation. This question is associated with an 11th "unknown" disability type.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Disability severity</h3>
<p>The extent of a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory or other limitation.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada's 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability calculated for each person the level of difficulty experienced in performing certain tasks and the frequency of activity limitations. To simplify the concept of severity, four severity classes were established:</p>
<ul>
 <li>mild</li>
 <li>moderate</li>
 <li>severe</li>
 <li>very severe</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_10">Annex B - Stakeholder Consultation Activity List</h2>
<p>This annex outlines the various consultations, engagements, and research used to develop the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) 2023-2025 Accessibility Plan:</p>
<h3 class="h4">Internal Surveys, Consultations, and Research</h3>
<h4>2019 CRA accessibility surveys - What we heard report</h4>
<p>In 2019, the CRA surveyed employees who identified as persons with disabilities and their managers to better understand the barriers that these employees face within the organization. As well, this survey gathered feedback on implementing workplace accommodations. These consultations highlighted that inclusion in the workplace and career development are of significant concern to employees with disabilities. Respondents added that we can improve by promoting a culture that encourages empathy, respect for, and appreciation of others, particularly persons with disabilities.</p>
<h4>Public service employee surveys</h4>
<p>The <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey/2020.html">2020 Public Service Employee Survey</a> took place from <span class="nowrap">November 30, 2020</span> to <span class="nowrap">January 29, 2021.</span> The survey was overseen by the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer from the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. This comprehensive survey measured federal government employees' opinions about their engagement, leadership, workforce, workplace, workplace well-being, and compensation. Survey results include the unique workplace experience of <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey/2020/pses-employee-results-dashboards/pses-results-persons-with-disability.html">persons with disabilities</a>.</p>
<p>A total of 188,786 employees in 87 federal departments and agencies responded to the 2020 Public Service Employee Survey, for a response rate of <span class="nowrap">61%.</span> <span class="nowrap">8.9%</span> of those respondents who answered the question "Are you a person with a disability?" identified as living with a disability.</p>
<h4>The CRA's Persons with Disabilities Network</h4>
<p>The Accessibility Centre of Expertise and Agency Secretariat (ACEAS) meets with the Network on a weekly basis to discuss the Agency's accessibility activities. Members of the Network contributed to identifying barriers and actions for the CRA's Accessibility Plan, and provided feedback that guided the development of the Accessibility Plan.</p>
<h4>CRA Employees with Disabilities</h4>
<p>In August 2022, the CRA shared a preliminary draft of the Accessibility Plan and requested feedback from employees with disabilities. Respondents felt overall that the Plan captured the most important barriers to accessibility for persons with disabilities, but it could be improved by clarifying actions and outcomes. They also highlighted the importance of culture change, education, and greater support for employees with disabilities in terms of hiring, promotion, and retention.</p>
<h4>Board of Management</h4>
<p>The CRA's <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/board-management.html">Board of Management</a> reinforces the Agency's commitment to being a world-class tax and benefit administration. The Board also supports the Agency's transformation, to further improve, accelerate, and excel, especially in the areas of service, people, financial resources, integrity and security, and innovation. The Board is responsible for developing the Agency's Corporate Business Plan which provides an overview of the CRA's objectives, strategies, performance expectations and financial projections.</p>
<p>The Board of Management was consulted on the direction of this Accessibility Plan and its key elements.</p>
<h4>Surveys, Consultations, and Research involving the Public</h4>
<h4>Review of public programs and services</h4>
<p>In July 2021, CRA employees did a review to identify accessibility barriers in the CRA's public-facing programs and services. The review found the following gaps:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Employees do not clearly understand accessibility, including how to provide accessible services to persons with disabilities;</li>
 <li>Our manuals, procedural documents, and communications can be difficult to follow and use language that is not accessible to all, and</li>
 <li>Clients have limited opportunities to provide their feedback and bring accessibility barriers to our attention.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interviews with community organizations</h4>
<p>In winter 2021-2022, the CRA interviewed community organizations from across Canada that support persons with disabilities in connecting with the CRA on matters related to taxes and benefits. Findings included:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought–it should be built in from the beginning in order to be "accessible by default";</li>
 <li>For something to be accessible, clients need to be able to access it independently as much as possible, and;</li>
 <li>Community organizations want to be empowered to better help their clients engage with the Agency, in the manner that best aligns with clients' needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Public consultations with persons with disabilities</h4>
<p>In April and May 2022, the CRA held a six-week-long <a href="/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/accessibility-consultation-report.html">public consultation process</a> to learn about accessibility barriers that persons with disabilities have encountered with the CRA's external programs and services, and how those barriers affected their experiences. The consultation process was designed and facilitated by a neutral third party (Delaney and Associates Inc.), who worked with the CRA to carry out the consultation and to analyze findings.</p>
<p>A total of 627 people participated in the process through virtual group discussions, video and phone interviews, an online questionnaire, and phone and email submissions. The input received from participants was foundational to this Accessibility Plan. While participants shared many barriers and solutions to barriers, three key themes emerged through this process:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Awareness and respect</li>
 <li>Accessing information</li>
 <li>Options for interaction</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disability Advisory Committee</h4>
<p>The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/disability-advisory-committee.html">Disability Advisory Committee</a> advises the Minister of National Revenue and the CRA on how the CRA can improve the way it administers and interprets tax measures for Canadians with disabilities. The Committee is made up of 12 members and 2 co-chairs and includes professionals from various fields, such as health professionals, lawyers, accountants, and tax professionals, as well as advocates of the disability community, representatives of Indigenous communities, and persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>In 2022, the CRA met with the Disability Advisory Committee during the development of the Accessibility Plan, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Providing updates on the progress of our Accessibility Plan;</li>
 <li>Sharing the CRA's overall progress in delivering upon its obligations under the Accessible Canada Act, including research, public consultations, and engagement activities, and;</li>
 <li>Discussing questions about accessibility with Committee members.</li>
</ul>
<h4>External Advisory Panel on Service</h4>
<p>The CRA's External Advisory Panel on Service supports the CRA service transformation efforts by providing advice on emerging trends, plans, and practices in service design and delivery. Chaired by the CRA's Chief Service Officer, the Panel is comprised of senior leaders and experts from the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors with expertise in digital services, client-centric service design, and innovation.</p>
<p>The CRA presented an overview of multiple service projects, including the Accessibility Plan, to the Panel. The Panel discussed how client and digital services go hand-in-hand, how to ensure clients have the resources to use digital solutions (such as access, affordability, knowledge) and that no unintended barriers are created for those who require different channels.</p>
