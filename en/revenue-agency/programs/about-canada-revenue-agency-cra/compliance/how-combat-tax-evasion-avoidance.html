                  <summary>What is tax evasion</summary>
                  <p>When an individual or business falsifies records and claims, hides income or inflates expenses in order to intentionally avoid complying with Canada’s tax laws, it is considered tax evasion.</p>
                  <p>Tax evasion, unlike tax avoidance, has criminal consequences. A criminal investigation may result in prosecution in criminal court, which could lead to court imposed fines, imprisonment, and a criminal record.</p>

                  <summary>What is tax avoidance</summary>
                  <p>When tax planning reduces taxes in a way that is inconsistent with the overall spirit of the law, the arrangements are referred to as tax avoidance. The CRA's interpretation of the term "tax avoidance" includes all unacceptable and abusive tax planning. Aggressive tax planning refers to arrangements that push the limits of acceptable tax planning.</p>
                </details>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>Tax evasion and avoidance have often revolved around secrecy and hiding assets, transactions, income, and wealth. What has changed over the years is the sophistication of the arrangements used by taxpayers and their representatives.</p>
            <p>Ongoing financial investments by the Government of Canada directed at collaboration with domestic and international partners, technological advancements, and data sources, have advanced the CRA in its efforts to make sure everyone pays the taxes they owe. These measures help the CRA target those who are non-compliant and side-step reporting obligations or push or exceed the legal limits of tax planning to evade or avoid taxes .</p>
            <p>Those who wilfully choose not to fulfill their tax obligations can face serious consequences, including criminal charges, prosecution, court imposed fines, jail time, and a criminal record.</p>
            <h2 id="h-1">We ensure compliance for all Canadians</h2>
            <p>The CRA’s compliance activities are important for Canadians. Taxes not only support government services and programs, they also aid economic developments within Canada through investments in several areas such as infrastructure and employment.</p>
            <p>The CRA’s success in ensuring compliance and supporting government services, programs, and economic developments can be measured by its fiscal impact. </p>
            <p>Fiscal impact reflects the contribution to the federal and provincial government treasury as a result of conducting audits and  examinations on Canadian and non-resident taxpayers in accordance with the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, <i>Excise Tax Act</i> and other legislation administered by the CRA.</p>
            <p>Fiscal impact consists of federal and provincial tax assessed (participating provinces only), federal and provincial tax refunds reduced, interest and penalties, and present value of future federal tax assessable arising from compliance actions. It does not account for the impact of appeals reversals and uncollected amounts.</p>
            <p>Over the last few years, the CRA’s fiscal impact has improved. We are proud to support economic developments and deliver key services through our compliance activities.</p>

Under the agreement and the Canadian legislation and the intergovernmental agreement, Canadian financial institutions are required to report specific information to the CRA for financial accounts held in Canada by U.S. residents and U.S. citizens. The CRA then provides this information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an annual basis through the provisions and safeguards of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty. The IRS reciprocates by providing similar information to the CRA on an annual basis.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>cross-border rulings related to preferential regimes (for Canada this would include international shipping and certain foreign life insurance operations of a Canadian company)</li>

                  <p>Since January 2015, certain financial intermediaries, including banks, have been required to report international electronic funds transfers (EFTs) of $10,000 or more to the CRA. This is detailed financial transaction information related to international wire transfers entering or leaving Canada. This information helps the CRA to identify taxpayers who may be participating in aggressive tax avoidance or who may be attempting to conceal income and assets offshore.</p>
                  <p>For the period of April 2016 to March 2020, the CRA completed reviews of all reported EFTs that were associated with jurisdiction or financial institutions of concern, otherwise known as the Jurisdiction of Concern (JOC) project. Generally speaking jurisdictions or financial institutions of concern are usually those that operate in countries that have low or no effective tax rate or have banking secrecy or confidentiality laws that provide for anonymity.</p>
                  <p>The JOC project is complete and intelligence derived from this project is integrated into the CRA’s risk assessment processes. Currently, the CRA can automatically match and integrate the EFT data with other information in our internal systems, allowing for improved risk assessment. This allows the CRA to identify the highest-risk taxpayers across multiple jurisdictions and financial institutions.</p>
                  <p>The CRA uses the EFT data to assess risk and identify taxpayers with potential offshore non-compliance issues.</p>

                  <p>This release contains almost 12 million documents that reveal hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering.</p>

            <h3>Risk-based audits</h3>
            <p>The CRA continues to use tools such as enhanced business intelligence and advanced data analytics to improve the risk assessments of individuals and businesses. For example, every year the CRA uses electronic tools to conduct risk assessments of the corporate tax returns of all large businesses. This improves our ability to identify high-risk transactions and allows us to focus our audit resources in the areas of highest risk.</p>
            <h3>Legal tools</h3>
            <p>Through a variety of effective legal tools, the CRA pursues taxpayers that knowingly challenge and test the limits of Canada’s self-assessment tax system. By taking high complexity cases to the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada, the CRA is sending a strong message that it won’t back down in its efforts to uncover and identify remedies for critical tax loopholes that may be exploited by the taxpayers.</p>
            <p>We are also working diligently with our partners in the Department of Finance Canada and the Department of Justice Canada to evaluate and propose new and enhanced tax legislation and policy that will help us close tax loopholes used by promoters and tax advisors to help their clients avoid paying the appropriate amount of taxes.</p>

                  <summary>General anti-avoidance rule</summary>
                  <p>The GAAR is a legal tool used by the CRA to distinguish legitimate tax planning from abusive tax avoidance. The GAAR tries to balance protecting the tax base with a taxpayer’s need for certainty when planning their affairs. </p>
                  <p>Since 1988, the CRA has invoked the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) when a taxpayer attempts to circumvent or exploit the intent of Canada’s tax rules and avoid paying the taxes they owe. The GAAR’s purpose is to deny tax benefits to taxpayers that are not in accordance with the object, spirit or purpose of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> and <i>Excise Tax Act</i>, even if they comply with a literal reading of the legislation.</p>
                  <p>Cases reviewed for application of the GAAR (cumulative):</p>
                  <ul class="fa-ul colcount-md-2  colcount-lg-3">

                  <p>Note: The actual number of taxpayers whose tax returns were reassessed as a result is much greater than these numbers because many tax avoidance schemes involved multiple partners, related parties, or groups of investors.</p>

                  <summary>Unnamed persons requirement</summary>
                  <p>The CRA has expanded its information sources by better leveraging ongoing audits findings and third-party data as intelligence that help to support the use of unnamed persons requirements (UPRs) aimed at identifying additional non-compliant taxpayers.</p>
                  <p>To better detect activity in new and emerging sectors, such as crypto-asset and platform economy activities, the CRA has increased its use of information from third parties. UPRs are a legal tool used to gather information from third parties (such as, crypto-asset intermediaries facilitating crypto-asset transactions) to identify taxpayers and registrants involved in crypto-asset activities and other digital economy environments. As a result, the CRA is better leveraging audits findings and third-party data to obtain authorization from the courts to use UPRs in identifying non-compliant taxpayers and addressing non-compliance.</p>
                  <p>The CRA also uses the information obtained through UPRs to identify beneficial owners of offshore entities, offshore bank and investment accounts.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the CRA issues UPRs to property developers and builders that have information about buyers involved in an assignment sale. This information is used to identify taxpayers who may not be reporting income tax or GST/HST.</p>

                  <summary>Compliance orders</summary>
                  <p>The CRA may seek a compliance order from the Federal Court of Canada under the <i>Income Tax Act</i> or the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> when a taxpayer or third-party fails to comply with a request or requirement for information.</p>
                  <p>The CRA enlists the Department of Justice to seek a compliance order where the information requested is not being provided. A judge must be satisfied that the taxpayer was required under legislation to provide what is being requested and be assured it is not subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.</p>
                  <p>Failure or refusal to comply with a court imposed compliance order could result in the person being found in contempt of court, and potentially resulting in possible fines or jail time.</p>

                  <p>The real estate sector is one of the many sectors that is addressed through our risk-based method. The CRA enhances its comprehension of non-compliance behaviour in the real estate sector through experience and the use of third-party data, such as data obtained through UPRs. This results in a greater number of audits and non-audit compliance interventions.</p>

                  <summary>Criminal investigations process</summary>
                  <p>A criminal investigation involves many steps such as gathering evidence, interviewing taxpayers and witnesses, executing search warrants and analyzing evidence. The length of time required to investigate will be dependent on the complexity of the case, the number of individuals and/or businesses involved, the availability of evidence, the need for international requests for assistance and the level of cooperation of witnesses. As with any criminal investigation undertaken by law enforcement, the CRA’s criminal investigations can be complex and often require years to complete.</p>
                  <p>In a CRA criminal investigation, investigators prepare a comprehensive report based on the results of the investigation, and send it to the PPSC where charges are believed to be warranted. The PPSC will then independently review the evidence and decide whether to initiate and conduct a prosecution on behalf of the federal Crown.</p>
                  <p>Note: The CRA selects cases for criminal investigation based on priority and impact on compliance. Our enhanced strategic file selection process results in the targeting of the most serious and complex cases.</p>
          <p>Various sources of information can lead the CRA to initiate a criminal investigation. </p>

                  <p>Over the last five fiscal years, we have seen an increase in the number of convicted taxpayers that received jail time. In addition, between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2023, the average fine increased by 43% compared to the previous five-year period, rising to an average of $171,699.</p>

                  <summary>Publication of prosecutions</summary>
                  <p>The CRA publicizes tax evasion and tax fraud convictions. The CRA may also, on occasion, release prejudgment information at different stages of a criminal investigation or prosecution, including, but not limited to, the execution of a search warrant, seizure of assets, and/or the laying of criminal charges. Publishing this information serves to maintain the integrity of Canada’s self-assessment tax system and warns Canadians about potential illegal tax schemes, and to deter others from committing tax and other financial crimes.</p>

            <h2 id="h-7">We keep you informed about tax schemes</h2>
            <p>A key part of the CRA’s compliance strategy is to target promoters of tax schemes.</p>
            <p>Tax schemes are plans and arrangements that attempt to deceive taxpayers by promising to reduce the taxes they owe, often through large deductions, tax credits, or promises of tax-free income.</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Promoters of tax schemes</summary>
            <p>Individuals or corporations who promote or sell schemes that seek to break or bend the rules of the Canadian tax laws. Promoters deliberately make false statements to assist their clients in avoiding and evading tax. As a result, they obtain a financial benefit from the fees they receive from their client.</p>
      </details>
            <p>Through increased audits of promoters, improved intelligence gathering, and better communication with taxpayers, the CRA continues to identify and shut down illegitimate tax shelters and tax schemes. Those who choose to participate in or promote these schemes may face serious consequences, including <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic01-1/third-party-civil-penalties.html">penalties</a>, court-imposed fines, and possibly even jail time.</p>

                    <p>You may be eligible for a reward when you tell the CRA about international tax non-compliance through the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/offshore-tax-informant-program.html">Offshore Tax Information Program (OTIP)</a>.</p>
                    <p>The OTIP was launched in January 2014 as part of CRA’s efforts to combat international tax evasion and avoidance.</p>
                    <p>It allows for financial rewards to be made to individuals who provide specific and credible information related to major international tax non-compliance that leads to the collection of at least $100,000 in federal taxes owing.</p>

                      <p>The CRA encourages anyone, no matter where they are in the world, to come forward if they have information about major international tax non-compliance.</p>
                      <p>By reporting on suspected international tax non-compliance, informants are not only benefiting from the possible rewards, but contributing to the administration of a fair tax system where everyone pays their taxes. This ensures greater resources are available for public facilities such as schools, roads and hospitals; as well as for the delivery of services and programs to Canadians.</p>

                        <li>The OTIP received approximately 1,080 written submissions</li>
