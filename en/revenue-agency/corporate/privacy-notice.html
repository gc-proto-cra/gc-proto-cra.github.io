<p>The <a href="/eng/acts/P-21/index.html">Privacy Act</a> came into force on July 1, 1983. The act protects the privacy of individuals by stating the requirements for collecting, keeping, using, disclosing, and disposing of personal information held by government institutions. The act also gives individuals (and their authorized representatives) the right of access to their personal information, with limited and specific exceptions, and with certain rights to correct or annotate it.</p>
<p>Requests under the Privacy Act are made by individuals who are looking for their personal information. However, there are limited and specific exceptions when others can request your personal information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the individual making the request has the written consent of the individual that the information is about</li>
<li>when the requester is a legal representative for an estate</li>
<li>when the request involves a compelling public interest</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/eng/acts/A-1/">Access to Information Act</a> came into force on July 1, 1983. It gives Canadian citizens, along with persons and corporations in Canada, the right to ask for access to federal government records. The act is based on three main principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>government information should be available to the public</li>
<li>exceptions to the right of access should be limited and specific</li>
<li>decisions about disclosures should be reviewable independently of government</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc17/taxpayer-bill-rights-guide-understanding-your-rights-a-taxpayer.html">Taxpayer Bill of Rights</a> states that you have the right to complete, accurate, clear, and timely information.</p>

        <summary>What happens when you interact with us online?</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>When you visit the web pages of any Government of Canada organization, most web servers automatically collect information about that visit. We safeguard the privacy of users of our web pages, in accordance with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26761">Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics</a>.</p>
<h3>IP addresses</h3>
<p>Web servers may automatically collect information about a visit to a website, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. The IP address is collected to identify unauthorized attempts to upload information, change information, or otherwise cause damage.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Digital markers (including cookies)</h3>
<p>We may use sessional and persistent digital markers on some web pages to better understand your preferences and provide you with the best possible web experience. A digital marker is a resource created by your browser to reference certain pieces of information during the same or a later visit to a web page. During your online session with the CRA, your browser exchanges data with our web server.</p>
<p>You can adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies. However, doing so may affect your ability to interact with our web pages. For example, if you are accessing any secure services that require a username and password and if you disable any cookies, you may need to re-insert your username and password at every visit to a website.</p>
<p>Examples of digital markers are cookies and HTML5 web storage. Among other functions, digital markers:</p>
<ul>
<li>let a website recognize a previous visit each time a visitor accesses a site.&nbsp;</li>
<li>track the information viewed on a site, to help website administrators make sure visitors find what they are looking for. For example, the number of mouse clicks made by an individual can indicate whether or not content was easy to find.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web analytics</h3>
<p>Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about web visits to understand web usage and to maintain and improve web service. When your computer asks for a CRA web page, we collect information under the authority of <a href="/eng/acts/c-10.11/page-1.html#h-49660">section 5 of the Canada Revenue Agency Act</a>, for analytics purposes, which may be used for IT related audits, evaluations, research, planning, and reporting, as well as communications and information technology statistics. The following types of information will be collected during a visit to our web pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>part of the originating IP address</li>
<li>the date and time of a request</li>
<li>the type of browser used</li>
<li>the page(s) visited</li>
</ul>
<p>We do web analysis with services from third-party service providers.</p>
<p>Information used for the purpose of web analytics is collected following the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26761">Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics</a>.</p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>Our use of social media is an extension of our presence on the web. Our social media account is not hosted on Government of Canada servers. If you choose to interact with us through social media, you should consult the terms of service and privacy policies of the third-party service provider and those of any applications you use, so that you understand how personal information is used. We use the social media platforms Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook.</p>

<h3>IP address</h3>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique number assigned by an Internet service provider to any device used to access the Internet. A web server automatically logs the IP address of a visitor to its site. An IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an Internet service provider, an IP address could be used to identify an individual using a site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers an IP address to be personal information.</p>
<h3>Web analytics</h3>
<p>As part of web analytics, information in digital markers may be used to remember your online interactions with our web pages. We use Webtrends, and we keep information for web analytics for a maximum period of 18 months. After that period, the information is disposed of according to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26761">Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics</a> and the provisions of the <a href="/eng/acts/L-7.7/">Library and Archives of Canada Act</a>.</p>
<p>We use Adobe Analytics (Adobe Systems Inc.), which is based in the United States of America. This means that the information collected (that is, truncated IP addresses, date and time of a request, type of browser used, and pages visited) is sent outside of Canada and may be subject to American law, including the Patriot Act. To strengthen privacy, the truncated IP addresses are converted into non-recognizable strings at the Canada.ca server-level prior to being submitted to Adobe Analytics.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems Inc. operates servers in other countries, which may be used to process web analytics data. So that data may be subject to the governing legislation of the country where it is processed. The Government of Canada has advised Adobe Analytics that it may store personal information only on servers located in Canada, the United States of America, the European Union, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>For more information about the privacy policy of a service provider, please visit their website or visit: <a href="/ca/privacy.html">Adobe Marketing Cloud Privacy</a>.</p>
<p>To track visits for web analysis, Adobe Analytics uses digital markers (cookies). If you want, you may opt out of having your visit tracked by changing your browser settings to refuse cookies, disabling JavaScript within your browser, or downloading and installing a browser add-on.</p>
<p>If you change your browser settings to refuse cookies or disable JavaScript so that your visit will not be tracked, no information will be collected. However, your visit may be affected in other ways, including being blocked from secure services that require a username and password.</p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>Personal information that you provide to us through a social media account is collected under the authority of <a href="/eng/acts/c-10.11/page-1.html#h-49660">section 5 of the Canada Revenue Agency Act</a>. This information is collected to capture conversations (for example, questions and answers, comments, likes/favourites, retweets/shares) between you and us, in order to respond to enquiries, or for statistical, evaluation, and reporting purposes. Comments posted that violate Canadian law will be moderated or hidden and disclosed to law enforcement authorities. Comments that violate our rules of engagement will also be moderated or hidden. The use of personal information in the context of social media is described in <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu938">Personal Information Bank, CRA PSU 938, Outreach Activities</a>.</p>
