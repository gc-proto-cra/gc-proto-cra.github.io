                <h2 id="h-1">We may ask you for additional information</h2>
                <p>When the review of your request is underway, we may contact you if we need any clarification of the facts and reasons, or to obtain any missing information.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-2">How we review your request</h2>
                <p>It is a general CRA practice for another CRA official, or a committee of CRA officials, to prepare a decision report for the designated official's consideration, including a recommendation on whether or not granting relief is warranted. The final decision, including notifying you of the decision, is the responsibility of the designated official.</p>
                <p>In all cases, once the review of your request is complete, we will notify you of our decision, including the reason for the decision if it is only partially approved or denied.</p>

                <h3>Factors used in arriving at the decision</h3>
                <p>Where circumstances beyond your control, actions of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), or inability to pay or financial hardship has prevented you from complying with your tax obligations, the following factors will be considered when determining whether or not the CRA will cancel or waive penalties or interest:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>your history of compliance with your tax obligations</li>
                  <li>whether or not you knowingly allowed an arrears balance to exist upon which arrears interest has accrued</li>
                  <li>whether or not you exercised a reasonable amount of care in conducting your tax affairs, and whether or not negligence or carelessness has been demonstrated</li>
                  <li>whether or not you acted quickly to remedy any delay or omission</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third-party actions</h3>
                <mark>This appears like eligibility rather than after you apply?</mark>
                <p>You are generally considered to be responsible for errors or delays made by a third party acting on your behalf for tax related matters. A third party who receives a fee and gives incorrect advice, or makes arithmetic or accounting errors, is usually regarded as being responsible to their client for any penalty and interest charged because of their actions. However, there may be exceptional situations when it may be appropriate for the CRA to provide relief because of third-party errors or delays.</p>
                <p>For example, it may be appropriate to consider granting relief from penalties and interest, in whole or in part, when an extraordinary circumstance beyond the control of a taxpayer's representative or actions of the CRA (as described under <a href="eligibility.html#h-1">Situations that may qualify</a>) have prevented the taxpayer from meeting their tax obligations.</p>

                <mark>I couldn't find anything about this online. It was one of the key sections on the Remissions page, however, and I wonder if it's also a top task for this page for cancel/waive penalties or interest</mark>

                <p>When the CRA has made a decision to grant your request for relief, you will be given one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reductions in refunds</li>
                  <li>Refund interest</li>

                <h2 id="h-6">Recourse if your request is denied</h3>
                <h3>Second administrative review</h3>
                <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in considering your request, you can ask for a second review. You may request a second review by writing to the address provided in the decision letter you received in reply to your first request for relief, or by writing to the Intake Centre responsible for your province or territory of residence.</p>
                <p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, e.g., not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing or misinterpreted or not considered in their proper context</li>
                  <li>any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To maintain impartiality and transparency, the second review will not be conducted by the CRA official involved in the first review and decision.</p>
                <p>The CRA may still uphold its previous decision following a second review of your request for relief. If you feel that the discretion was not properly exercised during the second review, you can apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the CRA decision within 30 days of the date you received the CRA second review decision.</p>
                <h3>Judicial review</h3>
                <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in arriving at the decision, you can apply for judicial review of that decision to the Federal Court within 30 days of the date you received the CRA decision.</p>

                <h3>Requestion for remission review</h3>
                <p>If your request to cancel or waive interest or penalties is denied, but you believe you still have grounds for your request, you might still be able to make a remission request.</p>
