<h3><a id="nq1"></a>Telephone enquiries</h3>
<h4>Individual, benefits, and business&nbsp;– telephone enquiries service</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is this? </strong>This is a timeliness service standard for responding to individual tax, benefit, and business telephone enquiries once callers indicate that they want to speak with an agent. Should an agent be unable to fully resolve a caller's enquiry, a call transfer or a call-back may be needed. This may result in additional wait times. When call volumes result in excessive wait times, we may intermittently refer some calls to the <span class="nowrap">self-service</span> telephone options.</li>
<li><strong>Our standard:</strong> Our goal is to respond to your call within 15 minutes or less of opting to speak with an agent.</li>
