<p>A designated beneficiary will not have to pay tax on payments made out of the TFSA, as long as the total payments&nbsp;do not&nbsp;exceed the fair market value (<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#FMV">FMV<abbr title="Fair market value"></abbr></a>)&nbsp;of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of the holder's death.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries (other than a survivor) can contribute any of the amounts they receive to their own TFSA as long as they have <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#nsdtfscntrbtnrm">unused TFSA contribution room</a> available.</p>
<p>A survivor who is a beneficiary has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#srvvrpymnt">survivor payment</a> as an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#Exemptcontribution">exempt contribution</a> to their own TFSA.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>If there is no successor holder, the TFSA ceases to exist when the holder of a deposit or an annuity contract under a TFSA dies. The holder is considered to have disposed of the contract or the deposit immediately before the time that the TFSA ceased to exist for an amount equal to the FMV of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of death.</p>
<p>After the holder's death, the deposit or annuity contract is considered to be a separate contract and is no longer considered as <span class="nowrap">a TFSA</span>. All earnings that&nbsp;grow after the holder's death will be taxable to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>The normal rules apply for reporting income or gains accrued after the date of death, depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or annuity contract. For example, interest earned would be reported on a <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5.html">T5, Statement of investment income</a>.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>If there is no successor holder, a TFSA that is an arrangement in trust is deemed to continue and it stays a <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> trust until the end of the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#Exemptperiod">exempt period</a>.</p>
<p>All income earned during the exempt period and paid to the beneficiaries, will be included in their income, while earnings that accrued before death remain exempt. In other words, any amount up to the FMV of the deceased holder's TFSA as of the date of death can be paid to beneficiaries, without them having to report any amount as income. Any amount paid to beneficiaries that represents an increase in the FMV after the date of death is taxable to the beneficiaries and has to be reported by them as income. Such payments will appear in <span class="nowrap">box </span>134 &quot;Tax<span class="nowrap">-Free</span> Savings Account taxable amount&quot; in the &quot;Other information&quot; section of a <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A, Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income</a>.</span></p>
<p>The trust has the exempt period within which to distribute both the taxable and <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> amounts. The trustee will assign the part of each payment that represents <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> FMV at the date of death with the rest being taxable.</p>
<p>Payments of amounts earned above the FMV made by the trust to a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> beneficiary, including a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> survivor, from a deceased holder's TFSA during the exempt period are reported on an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html">NR4, Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada slip</a>. These payments are subject to <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> withholding tax.</p>
<p>If the trust continues to exist beyond the end of the exempt period (for example, not all amounts from the deceased's TFSA have been paid to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward. It becomes a taxable inter-vivos trust with a tax year beginning <span class="nowrap">January 1st</span> of the following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and immediately reacquired its property for its FMV at that time. For as long as it continues to exist, the trust would itself be taxable on any undistributed income (including, for its first tax year, any undistributed income or gains during the exempt period) and required to annually file <span class="nowrap">a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3RET, T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a></span>. The trust will also be required to prepare a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">T3, Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations</a>, in that year or&nbsp;later years for any distributions of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>

        <p>Martin’s mother, who lived in a province that recognizes a TFSA beneficiary designation, passed away on January&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2024. The value of her TFSA on that date was&nbsp;$11,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. In her TFSA contract, she had named Martin as the sole beneficiary. Her estate was settled on June&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2024.

<p>The value of Martin’s late mother’s TFSA, as of the date of her death—$11,000, is not taxable. The income earned after the date of her death,&nbsp;$200, is taxable to Martin. He will receive a T4A slip showing this amount in box&nbsp;134 “Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount” in the “Other information” section.

        <p>If designated as a beneficiary, the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#Survivor">survivor</a> has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an exempt contribution to their own TFSA, without affecting their own <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#nsdtfscntrbtnrm">unused TFSA contribution room</a>, subject to certain conditions and limits.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries (other than the survivor) who receive a payment from the deceased holder's TFSA cannot contribute and designate any amount as an exempt contribution.</p>
<p>For the survivor to designate an exempt contribution, the amount must be received and contributed to their TFSA during <span class="nowrap">the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#rollover">rollover period</a></span>.

<p>Generally, if the TFSA of the deceased holder includes an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/definitions-tfsa.html#Excess">excess TFSA amount</a> at the time of death, if payments are being received by more than one survivor, or if the survivor payment and/or the contribution is made after the rollover period, no amount of the survivor payment can be designated as an exempt contribution.

        <p>Brian died on February&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2024. He was living with his common‑law partner, Fred, in Ontario. The value of his trusteed TFSA on that date was&nbsp;$9,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in his account. In Brian’s TFSA contract, he had not filled out the part about a successor holder, but he named Fred as the beneficiary. His estate was settled on August&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2024. By that time, an additional&nbsp;$150 of income had been earned, and the full amount of&nbsp;$9,150 was paid to Fred.</p>
<p>The value of Brian’s TFSA as of the date of his death, $9,000, is not taxable. The additional income earned after the date of death,&nbsp;$150, is taxable to Fred. His T4A slip will show an amount in box 134 “Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount” in the “Other information” section.</p>
<p>The amount paid to Fred, as the surviving common‑law partner, is considered a survivor payment. Since the survivor payment was made during the rollover period, Fred can rollover up to&nbsp;$9,000 (the value of the&nbsp;TFSA as of the date of death) to his own TFSA, as an exempt contribution.</p>
<p>An exempt contribution does not affect Fred’s unused TFSA contribution room. For the contribution of a survivor payment to be considered an exempt contribution during the rollover period, Fred must designate it on Form&nbsp;RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution – Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA), within 30 days after the contribution is made or at a later time as permitted by the Minister of National Revenue.</p>
