<h2 id="h_1">Interest</h2>
		    <h3 id="h_1_3">Interest on taxes owing</h3>
<p>If you have a balance owing for the current tax year and are unable to pay it by the April 30 payment due date, the CRA will start charging you compound daily interest as of <span class="nowrap">May 1, 2021</span>. This includes any balance owing if your return has been reassessed.</p>
	<p>The rate of interest the CRA will charge on current or previous balances can change every 3 months based on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rates</a>.</p>
		    <h3 id="h_1_1">Interest relief if you received COVID-19 benefits</h3>
		    
 <p>Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing will be given to people who have a total taxable income of $75,000 or less and received at least one COVID-19 benefit in 2020. </p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/covid19-taxes/interest-relief.html">Eligibility criteria for interest relief</a></p>
		    
		    <h3 id="h_1_2">Interest on tax instalment </h3>
		    
 <p>If the CRA requires you to pay tax instalments, you may need to send 4 payments before you file your tax return. If you miss any of these payments, you may need to pay instalment interest. </p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="instalments-interest-e.html">Instalment interest charges</a></p>


    



	
	<h2 id="h_2">Penalties</h2>
    

    
         <h3 id="h_2_1">Late-filing penalty</h3>
		    <p>The late-filing penalty is applied if you file your tax return after the April 30 due date and have a balance owing. If you cannot pay your balance owing, you should still file by the due date to avoid paying the late-filing penalty.</p>
	
		    <p>The late-filing penalty is <strong>5%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus an additional 1%</strong> for each full month you file after April 30, 2021, to a maximum of <strong>12 months</strong>.</p>
		    
<p>If the CRA charged a late-filing penalty on your return for 2017, 2018, or 2019, your late-filing penalty for 2020 may be <strong>10%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus 2%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing for each full month you file after April 30, 2021, to a maximum of <strong>20 months</strong>.</p>
	    
 <h3 id="h_2_2">Repeated failure to report income penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a federal and provincial or territorial penalty if you failed to report an amount of <strong>$500 or more in both</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2020 tax return</li>
	<li>2017, 2018, or 2019 tax return</li>
		    </ul>
		    
		    <p>The penalty is whichever is less:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20% of the amount you failed to report (10% federal and 10% provincial or territorial) </li>
	<li>50% of the difference between the understated tax (and/or overstated credits) related to the amount you failed to report and the amount of tax withheld related to the amount you failed to report</li>
</ul>
<p>If you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report, the CRA may waive these penalties. </p>

</dd>
<dt>Non-residents and deemed residents of Canada</dt>
<dd><p>The provincial or territorial penalty will be applied only if provincial or territorial tax is payable.</p></dd>
</dl>


         <h3 id="h_2_3">False statements or omissions penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty if you knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or omission on your 2020 return.</p>
<p>The penalty is whichever is greater:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100</li>
<li>50% of the understated tax and/or the overstated credits related to the false statement or omission</li>
</ul>
<p>If you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report and/or credits you overstated, the CRA may waive this penalty.</p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a></p>

    
<h3 id="h_2_4">Tax instalments penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty if your instalment payments are late or less than the required amount. We apply this penalty only if your instalment interest charges for 2021 are more than $1,000.</p>
