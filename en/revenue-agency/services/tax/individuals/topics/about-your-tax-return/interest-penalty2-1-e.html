</ul>


<h2 id="h_1">Interest on taxes owing</h2>
<p>If you have a balance owing for the current tax year and are unable to pay it by the April 30 payment due date, the CRA will start charging you compound daily interest as of <span class="nowrap">May 1, 2021</span>. This includes any balance owing if your return has been reassessed.</p>
	<p>The rate of interest the CRA will charge on current or previous balances can change every 3 months based on <a href="interest-penalty2-5-e.html">prescribed interest rates</a>.</p>
		    <h3 id="h_1_1">Interest relief if you received COVID-19 benefits</h3>

 <p>Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing will be given to people who have a total taxable income of $75,000 or less and received at least one COVID-19 benefit in 2020. </p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="interest-penalty2-6-e.html">Eligibility criteria for interest relief</a></p>

		    <h3 id="h_1_2">Interest on tax instalment </h3>

 <p>If the CRA requires you to pay tax instalments, you will need to pay by the set instalment payment due dates. If you miss any of these payment dates, you may need to pay instalment interest. </p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="instalments-interest-e.html">Instalment interest charges</a></p>







	<h2 id="h_2">Penalties for filing taxes late</h2>
    <p>If you file your taxes after the due date, your benefits may be delayed. If you have an unpaid balance owing when you file your taxes you may be subject to a late-filing penalty in addition to interest on the unpaid amount.</p>


         <h3 id="h_2_1">Late-filing penalty</h3>
		    <p>The late-filing penalty is applied if you file your tax return after the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals/filing-dates-tax-return.html">due date</a> and have a balance owing. If you cannot pay your balance owing, you should still file on time to avoid being charged the late-filing penalty.</p>

		    <p>The late-filing penalty is <strong>5%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus an additional 1%</strong> for each full month you file after the due date, to a maximum of 12 months.</p>

<p>If the CRA charged a late-filing penalty for 2017, 2018, or 2019 and requested a formal demand for a return, your late-filing penalty for 2020 will be <strong>10%</strong> of your balance owing. You will be charged an <strong>additional 2%</strong> for each full month you file after the due date, to a maximum of 20 months.</p>

<p>Late filing penalties still apply even if you are eligible for <a href-"interest-penalty2-6-e.html">interest relief due to COVID-19 benefits</a>.</p>

		    <h3 id="h_2_2">Tax instalments penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty if your instalment payments are late or less than the required amount. We apply this penalty only if your instalment interest charges for 2021 are more than $1,000.</p>
<p>For details: <a href="instalments-interest-e.html">Instalments penalty charges</a></p>


        <h2 id="h_3">Cancel or waive penalties or interest</h2>
<p>Under taxpayer relief provisions, the CRA has the discretion to cancel or waive penalties or interest. This applies when taxpayers are unable to meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control. </p>
<p>The CRA can only grant relief within a 10 year span from your request date.</p>

 <dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Interest</dt>
  <dd><p>Only considered for interest on a balance owing for a tax year that accrued within 10 years prior to your request. </p>
