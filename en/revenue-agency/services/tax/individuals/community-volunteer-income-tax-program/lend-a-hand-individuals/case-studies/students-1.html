<h3>Takeaway points</h3>

<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review their background information and the  required slips</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Interview setup</strong>, check the box  next to <strong>Employment income and employment  insurance benefits (T4, T4E/RL-6)</strong> in the <strong>Employment and other benefits</strong> section. Also, check the boxes next  to <strong>Pension income, other income and  split pension income, COVID-19 benefits (T4A, T4A(OAS), T4A(P), T4A-RCA, T4RSP,  T4RIF, T1032) </strong>in the<strong> Pension </strong>section<strong> </strong>and <strong>Student, education,  textbooks, student loans, and Canada training credit </strong>in the<strong> Student </strong>section</li>
  <li>Select <strong>T4  and employment income</strong> from the left side menu, add the T4 slip and enter  the information from Elise&rsquo;s T4 slip into the system</li>
  <li>Select <strong>T4A and pension income </strong>in the  left side menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>T4A – Pension,  retirement, annuity, and other income (COVID-19 benefits)</strong>, then select <strong>[105] Scholarships, bursaries, fellowship </strong>from  the drop-down menu under <strong>OTHER INFORMATION (COVID-19 benefits) </strong>and in the amount field next to it, enter the  amount from Elise&rsquo;s T4A slip</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Tuition, education, student loans </strong>in the left side  menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>T2202  Tuition and enrolment certificate* (TL11A and TL11C)(line 32300)</strong></li>
  <li>In the <strong>Current  year tuition amount</strong> section, enter the amounts from Elise&rsquo;s <strong>T2202 – Enrolment and tuition certificate</strong> into the software </li>
  <li>In  the <strong>Transfer of current year unused  amounts</strong> section, to complete the field <strong>Treatment  of current year unused tuition amounts – federal</strong>, select <strong>Transfer to parent not processed</strong> from the drop-down  menu. Leave the field <strong>Portion of unused amount  to transfer federally (max $5,000) </strong>blank </li>
</ol>
<p>Since Elise is a full-time student, her  scholarship is fully exempt. Even so, she still needs to report her scholarship  income. Since the field <strong>Portion  of unused amount to transfer federally (max $5,000)</strong> was  left blank, the software calculated the maximum amount of tuition fees she can  transfer to her father on schedule 11, line 32700.</p>
<p> If an individual does not want to  transfer the maximum amount, they need to provide you with the exact amount  that they want to transfer which you can indicate in the transfer section of  the T2202.</p>
