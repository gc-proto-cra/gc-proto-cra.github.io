<h3>Takeaway points</h3>

<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review their background information  and the required slips</li>
  <li>Check the box next to <strong>Pension income, other income and split  pension income, COVID-19 benefits (T4A, T4A(OAS), T4A(P), T4A-RCA, T4RSP,  T4RIF, T1032)</strong> from the <strong>Pension</strong> section</li>
  <li>Select <strong>T4A and pension income</strong> from the left side menu and click the + sign  next to <strong>T4A – Pension, retirement,  annuity, and other income (COVID-19 benefits)</strong> from the <strong>Pension income</strong> section</li>
  <li>Enter the federal income tax  deducted, if any, into Field 22, then select the option applicable to the box  number from the <strong>Other information</strong> drop-down menu and enter the amount reported on the T4A</li>
  <li>For <strong>Repayments of a federal COVID-19 financial assistance</strong>, enter the  amount the individual wishes to claim for 2021</li>
</ol>
<p>An  individual who makes a repayment of federal COVID-19 benefits for amounts they  received in 2020 can claim the repayment as a deduction. They can choose  between claiming the full amount or a portion either in the year it was paid (2021)  or the year the benefit was received (2020). The repayment will show in box 201  of their T4A slip.</p>
<p> If the  individual received their CERB from Service Canada, the amount repaid will be  reported in box 30 of their T4E slip, along with other EI amounts repaid.</p>
<p> In this case,  Amy confirmed she wanted to claim the deduction for the $2000 repayment she  made, on her 2021 tax return.</p>
