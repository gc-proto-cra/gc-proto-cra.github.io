<h3>Takeaway points</h3>

<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>

Also, check the boxes next  to <strong>Pension income, other income and  split pension income, COVID-19 benefits (T4A, T4A(OAS), T4A(P), T4A-RCA, T4RSP,  T4RIF, T1032) </strong>in the<strong> Pension </strong>section<strong> </strong>and <strong>Student, education,  textbooks, student loans, and Canada training credit </strong>in the<strong> Student </strong>section</li>
  <li>Select <strong>T4  and employment income</strong> from the left side menu, add the T4 slip and enter  the information from Antoine&rsquo;s T4 slip into the system</li>
  <li>Select <strong>T4A and pension income </strong>in the  left side menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>T4A – Pension,  retirement, annuity, and other income (COVID-19 benefits)</strong>, then select <strong>[105] Scholarships, bursaries, fellowship </strong>from  the drop-down menu under <strong>OTHER INFORMATION (COVID-19 benefits) </strong>and in the amount field next to it, enter the  amount from Antoine&rsquo;s T4A slip</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Tuition, education, student loans </strong>in the left side  menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>T2202  Tuition and enrolment certificate* (TL11A and TL11C)(line 32300)</strong></li>
  <li>In the <strong>Current  year tuition amount</strong> section, enter the amounts from Antoine&rsquo;s <strong>T2202 – Enrolment and tuition certificate</strong> into the software </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Tuition,  education, student loans </strong>in the left side menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>Part-time</strong><strong> program  details if you received scholarship, fellowship, and bursary income to be  included at </strong><strong>line 13010 </strong></li>
  <li>Add the amount paid for tuition shown on the T2202 and  the cost of materials, then enter the result in <strong>Tuition fees and costs of part-time education program-related material  paid for current year</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Tuition, education, student loans </strong>in the left side  menu and click the <strong>+</strong> sign next to <strong>Canada  training credit (CTC). </strong>Enter the  CTCL amount from Antoine&rsquo;s 2021 NOA into the field <strong>Canada training credit  limit (CTCL) for 2021</strong>.

  <li>Leave the field <strong>Enter the Canada training credit  you are claiming</strong> blank </li>
</ol>
<p>Since Antoine is a part-time student,  his scholarship exemption is equal to the tuition fees he paid ($3,000), plus  the costs of program-related materials ($300), plus the $500 basic scholarship  exemption, for a total of $3,800. Since the amount of this calculation is  greater than the scholarship he received (3,000), there is no amount reported  on line 13010. The amount of tuition fees that Antoine can claim on line 32300  is reduced by the amount of the Canada training credit (CTC) he is claiming  this year. The $250 CTC amount is reported on line 45350 of his return. </p>
