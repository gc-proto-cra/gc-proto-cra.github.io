<h3>Takeaway points</h3>

<p>Steps to follow</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review their background information and the required slips</li>
  <li>Pension income splitting is a joint election that requires both spouses to produce their returns at the same time. When you complete the Spouse interview type, select Complete information (recommended) when answering the question What information will you provide for your spouse?</li>
  <li>From the Interview setup, in the Pension section, check the box next to Pension income, other income and split pension income, COVID-19 benefits (T4A, T4A(OAS), T4A(P), T4-RCA, T4RSP, T4RIF,T1032) and in the Investment income and expenses section, check the box next to Interest, investment income and carrying charges/interest expenses/CNIL (T3, T5, T4PS, T5008, RC359)</li>
  <li>Select T4A and pension income in the left side menu and click the + sign beside each of the following: T4A, T4A(OAS), T4A(P) and Split pension income with spouse; enter the amounts for each tax slip into the software </li>
  <li>Alexei’s T4A(P) indicates they received both CPP retirement and disability benefits throughout the year; since the sum of box 23 and box 21 (indicating number of months) cannot exceed 12, enter 6 in both box 23 and box 21</li>
  <li>Split pension income in the left side menu allows you to select how the software splits the eligible pension income. Select Let MaxBack decide as the answer to Do you wish to split eligible pension income with your spouse?</li>
  <li>Select Interest, investment income and carrying charges from the left side menu and click the + sign next to T5 – Investment income; enter the amounts from Alexei’s T5 into the software</li>
  <li>When you complete Nadia’s Interview setup, ensure there is no box checked in any section. If you check the box next to No income to report in 2022 in the Specific situations section of Nadia’s Interview setup, the software will not be able to finish the calculation of Nadia’s return</li>
</ol>
<p>Only box 16 of Alexei’s T4A – Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income is eligible for the pension income splitting. The amount transferred to Nadia will be reported on line 11600 of her return and the same amount will be reported on line 21000 of Alexei’s return. Any income tax withheld from the eligible pension income (box 22 of the T4A) will be split in the same proportion as the eligible pension income and appear on line 43700. The software will automatically generate form T1032 for each individual.</p>
