    </ul>
    <h2 id="h1">Identification and other information</h2>
    <p><strong>Name, address and date of birth</strong></p>
    <p>Always review the individual’s name, address and date of birth before you
      complete the tax return. Entering inconsistent information could either
      produce an error message when you send the tax return electronically, or
      change the information the CRA has on file for the individual.</p>
    <p>The address you enter on the tax return must be the individual’s mailing
      address on the day you submit the tax return.</p>
    <p>An individual's province or territory of residence is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the province or territory where they lived on December 31 of the tax year <strong>or</strong></li>
      <li>the province or territory of which they were considered to have the most residential ties to on December 31 of the tax year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, refer to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-address-information/your-province-territory-residence.html">Your province or territory of residence</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="h2">Marital status</h2>

    <p>You must indicate the marital status of the individual on December 31 of
      the tax year you are preparing, regardless if it changed during the same
      year or soon after.</p>
    <p>Review the following definitions to determine an individual's marital status.</p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Married</dt>
      <dd>Someone legally married to a person.</dd>
      <dt>Common-law</dt>
      <dd>Someone who lives in a marriage-like relationship with another person
        but is not legally married to that person, and at least one of the
        following situations applies:
        <ul>
          <li>the individual and their partner have lived together in a
            marriage-like relationship for at least 12 months in a row
            (including any time they were separated for less than 90 days
            because of a breakdown in the relationship)</li>
          <li>the individual has a child with their partner by birth or adoption</li>
          <li>the individual's partner has custody and control of the
            individual's child (or had custody and control immediately before
            the child turned 19 years of age), and the child depends entirely on
            the individual's common-law partner for support</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Separated</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Someone living apart from their spouse or common-law partner because
        of a breakdown in their relationship for a period of at least 90
        consecutive days. Once an individual has been separated for more than 90
        days, the effective day of the separated status is the day they started
        living apart.</p>
      <p>If you file a return for an individual before their 90-day separation
        period is over and that period includes December 31, enter the marital
        status as married or living common-law, as applicable. If, after you
        file the return, they continue to live separate and apart from their
        spouse or common-law partner and have been living this way for at least
        90 days, the individual can complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc65.html">Form RC65, Marital Status Change</a>,
        and use the date of the beginning of the 90-day period as their date of
        separation. They will also have to file an amended return to adjust
        their entitlement for any credits claimed or to apply for credits that
        they may not have been entitled to when they were married or living
        common-law.</p>
      <p>For example, if the individual separated from their spouse because of
        a breakdown in their relationship on December 30, 2021, their marital
        status on their 2021 tax return could be considered as separated on
        December 30 as of March 30, 2022. Preparing their taxes any date before
        March 30 would still be within the 90 day period and would require that
        you enter a marital status of married on their tax return.</p>

    <h2 id="h3"> Information about a spouse or common-law partner</h2>
    <p>In cases where you won’t be preparing the spouse or common-law partner’s tax return, the individual will be required to provide the following information about their spouse or common-law partner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first name</li>
      <li>SIN</li>
      <li>net income </li>
      <li>if applicable:
        <ul>
          <li>confirmation that they were self-employed during the year</li>
          <li>Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) amount shown on line 11700 of their tax return</li>
          <li>UCCB reimbursement amount indicated on line 21300 of their tax return</li>
        </ul>
      </li>    
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h4">How the tax return is calculated</h2>
    <p>There are four step to calculate a tax return:</p>

<ol class="lst-stps mrgn-tp-lg">
        <li>
          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-md">Total income &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp; Net income</h3>
          <p>Once you entered an individual's income from all sources, report the total income on line 15000. The deductions that an individual is eligible to claim will reduce the total income resulting in their net income (line&nbsp;23600). Use the net income to determine eligibility and calculate entitlement amounts for most federal and provincial/territorial credits and benefits.</p>
          <div class="well well-sm brdr-rds-0">
          <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
            <li><span class="mrgn-tp-0 text-muted h5">Total income <span class="nowrap">(line 15000)</span> <span class="small">Page 3 of tax return, lines: 10000's</span></span></li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-md">Net income &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp; Taxable income</h3>
          <p>Once the net income has been calculated, apply additional deductions to calculate the individual’s taxable income (line&nbsp;26000).</p>
          <div class="well well-sm brdr-rds-0">
          <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
            <li><span class="mrgn-tp-0 text-muted h5">Net income <span class="nowrap">(line 15000)</span></span></li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-md">Taxable income &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp; Total payable</h3>
          <p>Multiply the individual’s taxable income by the applicable escalating tax brackets. The amount of tax&nbsp; resulting form this calculation is then reduced by the total amount of non-refundable tax credits (line&nbsp;35000). The end result will give you the individual's total payable (line 43500).</p>
          <p>Provincial or territorial tax is also calculated using escalating tax brackets on the T1 income tax and benefit return for all provinces and territories except Quebec , where a separate provincial income tax return must be filed.</p>
          <div class="well well-sm brdr-rds-0">
          <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">

        <li>
          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-md">Total payable &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp; Refund, balance owing, nil</h3>
          <p>What you’ll need to know after you’ve done your taxes, including understanding your notice of assessment, paying off a balance owing, and interacting with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
          <p>In the final step, the total payable amount is reduced by the total income tax deducted (line 43700) and by the total amount of any refundable tax credits (line 48200) that the individual may be eligible to claim.</p>
          <p>There are three possible outcomes as a result of this calculation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a refund (line 48400),</li>
            <li>balance owing (line 48500)</li>
            <li>nil , meaning no refund and no balance is owing </li>
