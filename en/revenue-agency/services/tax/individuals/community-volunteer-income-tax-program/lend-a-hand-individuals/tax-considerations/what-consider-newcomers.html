    <h2 id="h1">Residency status for tax purposes</h2>
    <p>Canada taxes its citizens based on residency not on citizenship. There  are different types of residency statuses for tax purposes. As a volunteer, you  will be mainly working with individuals who are residents and newcomers.</p>
    <p> Newcomers are individuals who left another country to come and live in  Canada. For example, someone who arrived in Canada in 2021 is considered a  newcomer for the 2021 taxation year only.</p>
    <p> Residents are individuals who live in and have significant residential  ties with Canada. Most newcomers who move to Canada with the intentions of  staying here are considered residents from the time they enter Canada.</p>
    <p> All newcomers,  including refugees, can file a tax return as a resident of Canada. This applies  even if they have only been in the country for a few months and have not earned  income.</p>
    <p> Newcomer status  applies only for  the&nbsp;first tax year that the  individual is a new resident of Canada.<strong>  </strong>Afterwards, the individual will have been a resident for tax  purposes for the whole year and will then file a regular tax return.</p>
    <p> An individual&rsquo;s  residency status for tax purposes is important, as it determines whether or not  they are required to file an income tax return in Canada. A person&rsquo;s residency  status for tax purposes is different from their immigration status.</p>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Important note</h3> 
	<p> As a CVITP  volunteer, you are not  responsible for determining a person&rsquo;s residency status or to advise them of  their tax obligations.</p>
	</section>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p> If an individual  is unsure of their residency status, refer them to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining your residency status</a> &nbsp;or to the individuals&rsquo;  tax enquiries line. You may also  contact the CVITP  dedicated line on their behalf.</p>
    <h2 id="h2">Identification numbers</h2>
    <p>      One of the most  important steps when you use UFile CVITP  to prepare a return is the <strong>identification  section</strong> of the interview.</p>
    <p> Newcomers may  have an identification number other than a social insurance number (SIN), such  as an individual tax number (ITN) or a temporary tax number (TTN). These  numbers allow individuals to file their income tax return and apply for  benefits.</p>
    <p> What to consider  in relation to the different taxpayer-identification numbers:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Type of identification number</th>
    <th>Information to consider for    newcomers</th>
</tr>
</thead>
	<tr>
        <th>Social    Insurance Number (SIN)</th>
        <td><p>As a newcomer, the individual must have an identification number to    file their income tax return. Usually, they will have a SIN.<br>
          If the individual is waiting to receive their SIN, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>file a paper return leaving the SIN field blank and attach a    note to the return explaining that the individual is waiting for their SIN</li>
            <li>use UFile to prepare the return and enter zeros in the SIN    field; however, you will not be able to file electronically and will need to    print the return and attach a note explaining that the individual is waiting    for their SIN</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The tax return will be held until Service Canada issues the    individual's&nbsp;SIN.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Individual Tax Number (ITN)</th>
        <td><p>The    ITN is used only for non-residents and international students who are not    eligible to obtain a SIN.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the individual is an international student who does not    have a SIN, they should complete Form <u><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Individual Tax    Number (ITN) for Non-Residents</a></u> (even if they are a resident). The T1261 can be mailed to the    CRA with the printed copy of the return. The tax return will be held until an    ITN is issued</li>
            <li>If the individual already possesses an ITN, enter the ITN in    place of their SIN</li>
          </ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Temporary Tax Number (TTN)</th>
        <td><p>Residents    of Canada who are not entitled to receive a SIN or an ITN and are required to    file a return may be assigned a TTN. A TTN is a nine-digit number beginning    with a zero (01 or 03). This is an internal number that the CRA provides to    the individual. It is not possible to prepare an electronic return with a TTN.    You can prepare a paper return instead.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the individual already possesses a TTN, enter the TTN in    place of their SIN and mail in the tax return</li>
            <li>If the individual does not already have a TTN, mail the tax    return in with a letter confirming the individual is not eligible for a SIN    or an ITN, and that a TTN is requested. The CRA will contact the person and    inform them of the documentation that is required before it issues a TTN and    processes the return</li>
          </ul></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>As a volunteer,  you are not expected to provide assistance in filling out applications for an  identification number.</p>
    <p> If the  individual wants more information about obtaining a SIN, refer them to Canada.ca <u><a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html">Social Insurance Number - Overview</a></u>.</p>
    <h2 id="h3"> Date of entry</h2>
    <p>      The date of entry is the date when the  individual became a resident of Canada for income tax purposes. This usually  corresponds to the date the individual arrived in Canada. It is important to  enter the exact date, as this  could affect the amount of non-refundable tax credits that they may be entitled  to.</p>
    <p> In this example,  the date of entry is August 10, 2022. Based on the date of entry, a newcomer&rsquo;s <strong>first  year</strong> in Canada can be split into <strong>two periods</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when they were a <strong>non-resident</strong> of  Canada (January 1 to August 9, 2022)</li>
      <li>when they were a <strong>resident</strong> of Canada  (August 10 to December 31, 2022)</li>
    </ul>
<img class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md mrgn-tp-md" src="6.4-01-en.png" />
    <p>      For most newcomers, the income  they earned before they move to Canada is non-taxable. It does not need to be  included in the Total income  section of the return. However, since this income is required to calculate  certain benefits and credits, it is important to provide this information.</p>
    <h2 id="h4">Information about a newcomer&rsquo;s spouse</h2>
    <p>      If the newcomer&rsquo;s spouse or common-law partner lives  in Canada with them, proceed as usual.</p>
    <p> If a newcomer&rsquo;s spouse or common-law partner is  living abroad and they are separated for reasons other than a breakdown in  their relationship, you must still enter a marital status of either married or  common-law on their tax return.</p>
    <p> A non-resident spouse does not need to file a tax return in Canada.  Therefore, it is important to report the spouse&rsquo;s name and their net income in  Canadian dollars using the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/annual-average-exchange-rates/">annual exchange rates</a>. The CRA needs this information to calculate the  benefits and credits the individual living in Canada is entitled to.</p>
    <p> If newcomers provide financial support to their non-resident  spouse, they may be entitled to claim a spousal amount on their tax return. The  individual must keep any supporting documentation or receipts that prove the  non-resident spouse depended on them for support. The&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;may contact  the individual and ask them to provide all supporting documents at a later  date.</p>
    <h2 id="h5"> Reporting foreign property over $100,000 (Canadian)</h2>
    <p>      An individual  does <strong>not </strong>have to report foreign property for the year they first become  a resident of Canada.</p>
    <p> Foreign property <strong>does not</strong> include any personal use property, such as a primary residence,  vacation home, or cottage.</p>
<section class="mrgn-tp-md">

<div class="col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 brdr-lft mrgn-bttm-md">
  <h4 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Complex situation</h4>
    <p>If the individual <strong>owns foreign property</strong> and <strong>was a resident of Canada in any  previous year</strong>, you should <strong>not</strong> prepare the return.</p>
    <p> Foreign property owned includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bank accounts held abroad (interest)</li>
      <li>shares held in foreign corporations&nbsp;or shares held in a resident corporation but held outside of Canada</li>
      <li>vacant land abroad</li>
      <li>other income-earning foreign property</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Nice to know</h3> 
    <p>Remember to always convert all foreign income into  Canadian dollars. The Bank of Canada has <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/annual-average-exchange-rates/">Annual Exchange Rates</a> available for most countries.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
    <h2 id="h6">Income earned inside and  outside Canada</h2>
    <p>Newcomers must report any world income they earned while they were a&nbsp;<strong>resident</strong>&nbsp;of  Canada.</p>
    <p> In some instances, an individual may also have earned Canadian-sourced  income while they were a non-resident. They may be asked to report that income  if they wish to apply for the&nbsp;GST/HST&nbsp;tax credit, the Canada child  benefit (CCB) or other credits and benefits for which they qualify.</p>

    <h2 id="h7">Non-refundable tax credits</h2>
    <p>The amount a  newcomer can claim for non-refundable tax credits is proportional to the number  of days in the year they were considered to be a resident of Canada. The  amounts that they can claim are calculated based on their <strong>Date</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>entry</strong>.</p>
    <p> However, the 90%  rule allows individuals to claim all of their non-refundable credits, if their  taxable income in Canada represents 90% or more of their world income.</p>
    <p> You will have to  provide information about the individual&rsquo;s income during the non-resident  portion of the year. Providing this information will allow the software to  determine if the 90% rule applies when calculating the non-refundable tax  credits. You <strong>must</strong> report:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Canadian sourced income (excluding Part XIII</strong><strong>) they  earned when they were not a resident of Canada</strong>,such as income from an employer located&nbsp;in  Canada, income from a business carried on in Canada, or taxable  part of scholarships/fellowships/bursaries from Canada</li>
      <li><strong>Canadian source Part XIII </strong><strong>income PLUS  foreign sourced income they earned when they were not a resident of Canada</strong>, such as interest and dividends, rental income, pension income including  Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Quebec Pension Plan, and employment  income in another country</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h8">Net income while living with their spouse or  common-law partner in Canada</h2>
    <p>When an  individual is already a resident of Canada for tax purposes and their spouse or  common-law partner becomes a newcomer, the individual must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>provide all their information slips and income for the full year</li>
      <li>confirm their net income for the period when they lived with their spouse  or common-law partner in Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example,  Robert is a resident of Canada for tax purposes in 2022. His spouse arrives in  Canada as a newcomer on July 1, 2022. Robert provides his net income for the  period starting July 1 2022 to December 31 2022. You must enter this income in  the <strong>Immigrant, emigrant or non-resident</strong> section of the tax software.</p>

<section class="mrgn-tp-md">
<span class="pull-left mrgn-rght-md"><i class="fas fa-laptop fa-lg fa-fw"></i></span>
<div class="col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 brdr-lft mrgn-bttm-md">
  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Ufile tip</h3>
    <p>Generally, an individual and their spouse or  common-law partner arrive in Canada on the same date. If this is the case, the  tax software will automatically claim any credits the couple may be entitled  to.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
    <h2 id="h9">International students</h2>
    <p>Residency status for international students is more complex. They may not  establish significant residential ties with Canada if they return to their home  country on a periodic basis or for a significant amount of time in the calendar  year; or if they move to another country when not attending university in  Canada. It is up to the student to determine their residency status for tax  purposes.</p>
    <p> An international student is  considered a newcomer when they become a new resident of Canada for tax  purposes for the very first time.</p>
    <p> Newcomer status will not be  applied if the international student has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>been a  resident of Canada for tax purposes for a full year </li>
      <li>returned for  another semester and re-established residential ties, regardless of how long  their absence was as a non-resident, after having previously been established  as a resident of Canada for tax purposes in a previous year</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits and other credits</h2>
    <p>Newcomers may be entitled to benefits and  credits such as the Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST)  credit and the Canada child benefit (CCB). Refer the individuals to Canada.ca  Are you eligible for benefits and credits?&nbsp; </p>
