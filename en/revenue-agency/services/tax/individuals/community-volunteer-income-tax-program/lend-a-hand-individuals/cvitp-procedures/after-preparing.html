  <p>To ensure the program's success, organizations and volunteers must safeguard taxpayer information and understand their responsibilities in this respect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use or disclose the individual's information for any purpose other than to complete their return</li>
    <li>Store the individual's information securely in a locked drawer or cabinet and never leave  their information unattended</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings when speaking with individuals, especially in a virtual clinic setting when other people are present in your home or you have technological devices such as Google Home or Alexa</li>
    <li>In the event of any type of security breach, such as lost, stolen or compromised data, tell your community organization and your Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) coordinator immediately</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Once the tax return  has been prepared and successfully transmitted, ensure you take the necessary  steps to protect the individual&rsquo;s personal information and provide them with  correct information if adjustments are requested. </p>

<h2 id="h1">Return all  documentation to the individual</h2>
  <p>Do not keep any of  the individual&rsquo;s documents (paper or electronic).  This includes the completed TIS60 as well as any calculations or notes you might   have made.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Clear all user  information from UFile </h2>
  <p>If you work on a computer that you share   with other volunteers within your organization, be sure you clear all of your user information at the end of your shift. For  more information, refer to Finalizing  and sending the tax return. </p>
 
<h2 id="h3"> What comes next</h2>
  <p>Individuals may request an adjustment to  their tax return. Be aware that although you are not expected to assist with  adjustments as a CVITP volunteer, you may still choose to do so and are  expected to keep the following information in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before any adjustments can be made, the individual must first wait to  receive the notice of assessment for the year that needs adjustment </li>
    <li>Generally, a change can be made to a tax return for a tax year ending in  any of the ten previous calendar years (for example, a request made in 2021 cannot  apply to a tax return dated earlier than the 2011) </li>
  </ul>

<p>Individuals may ask to make an  adjustment to their tax return. As a CVITP volunteer you are not expected to  assist with adjustments, however if you choose to assist the individual keep  the following information in mind.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An individual must wait to receive their notice of assessment for the tax  year needing a change before requesting the adjustment.</li>
    <li>Generally, a change can be made to a return for a tax year ending in any of  the ten previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2021 must  relate to the 2011 or a later tax year to be considered.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The individual must have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>their notice of assessment for the tax year requiring the adjustment</li>
    <li>a copy of their tax return with all amounts reported</li>
    <li>any receipts or tax slips supporting the adjustment </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To request a change, the  individual must complete, sign and date form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html">T1-ADJ T1 Adjustment Request</a>. Volunteers can choose to assist the  individual but cannot act as their representative. Instructions on how to  complete form T1-ADJ can be found on the back of the form itself.</p>
  <p>If an individual wants to know when they  can reasonably expect to receive their notice of reassessment, you can refer to  Check<strong> </strong>CRA processing times  for the most up-to-date information.</p>

<p>If an individual returns to the organization  with follow-up questions about their return, refer them to the CRA&rsquo;s Individual  tax enquiries line, 1-800-959-8281. For any questions  about tax refunds, refer them to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/refunds.html">Tax refunds: When to expect your refund</a>.</p>
