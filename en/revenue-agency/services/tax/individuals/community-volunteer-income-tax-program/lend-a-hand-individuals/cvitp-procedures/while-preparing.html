<p>To complete  the signing of section II of TIS60, select one of the following options:</p>

  <h4 class="h5">Option 1: Send the TIS60 via password protected email to the  individual with Part C completed</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Send a generic email to the individual to ensure  they understand that email is not a secure method of communication, and also to  ensure you have the correct email address. </li>
	  <li>To protect your privacy, use a separate email  account and block your number from being displayed when communicating with  taxpayers. If the individual replies, providing consent and confirming the  address is correct, proceed with further communication. </li>
	  <li>Use email only as an option for obtaining consent  to file the TIS60 electronically. Avoid using email or social media channels to  prepare an individual&rsquo;s return. 
		<details>
		<summary>Sample of generic  email</summary>
		<p>  Hello,</p>
		<p> Due to concerns  surrounding COVID-19, (organization name) is unable to host tax clinics in  person. Therefore, I would like to communicate with you via email which is an  unsecure method of communication. All efforts will be made to ensure that your  personal information is protected throughout our correspondences. We would like  to confirm that we will not be saving any personal information and all emails  will be deleted upon filing your return. Please reply to this email to continue  using email to correspond with me, a CVITP volunteer, in order to complete your  income tax and benefit return(s).</p>
		<p> Thank you,</p>
		<p> (insert name of  CVITP volunteer) </p>
		</details>		  
      </li>

  <li>Use password protection on the PDF version of the  tax return or TIS60. A PDF reader is required to send or receive a password  protected PDF. For instructions, refer to <a href="../cvitp-training/navigating-through/identification.html">CVITP tax software overview</a>.</li>
  <li>Provide the password to the individual over the  phone, via text message or in a separate email. </li>
  <li>Send the password protected PDF to the individual  as an email attachment. Do not include the password in the same email as the  document(s).</li>
  <li>Advise the individual to:
	<ul>	  
	  <li>print, sign Part D, scan and email the form back to  you</li>
	  <li>print, sign Part D, take a picture and email or  text it back to you </li>
	  <li>print, sign Part D and show you the form on camera  using video conferencing n </li>
	  <li>electronically sign Part D of the form and email it  back to you </li>
 	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>	  

<h4 class="h5">Option 2: Provide a copy of the TIS60 with Part C completed  to the organization</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>The organization can arrange to have the individual  sign Part D and can notify you once the form has been signed. </li>
	  <li>The individual would retain the signed copy for their  records.</li>
	</ul>


<h4 class="h5">Option 3: Obtain verbal consent from the individual</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You will use this option, only if you cannot follow  through with options 1 or 2.</li>
  <li>To obtain verbal authorization from the individual,
<details>	  
	<summary>Read the following script:</summary>

		<p>Before I file your  return, please confirm the amounts I am about to share with you are correct and  complete, and that you have fully disclosed your income from all sources. Also,  please confirm that you authorize me to file your return electronically </p>
		<p>Based on the information  you provided:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>your total income is $XXXX, </li>
			  <li>your taxable income is $XXXX, </li>
			  <li>your total non-refundable tax credits are $XXXX, and </li>
			  <li>you have a balance owing/refund of $XXXX. </li>
			</ul>

		<p>Do you authorize me to  EFILE your return with the amounts I just read to you? </p>

</details>	
	</li>
</ul>


<p>Once the individual signs the TIS60 or you have  obtained their verbal consent, EFILE the return. If the return cannot be  transmitted, print a paper copy of the return for the individual and ask them to  mail it to the CRA for processing. Refer to Find a CRA address to ensure that  you provide them with the correct mailing address for their applicable  Tax Centre.</p>

  <h2 id="h2">Transmitting the return </h2>
  <p>Each person's return  must be transmitted individually, immediately  upon completion. For step-by-step instructions on how  to transmit the return using UFile CVITP, refer to <a href="../navigating-through/review.html">Finalizing and sending the return</a> under the CVITP tax software  overview.</p>

<p> There may be  circumstances when it may not be possible to transmit a return immediately upon  completion such as in clinic locations where internet isn&rsquo;t available. </p>
  <p> In instances where  you are unable to transmit a return immediately, ensure that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Always</strong> encrypt returns using the tax software and save  the files on a USB flash drive <strong>only</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never</strong> save a copy of the individual's return on the hard  drive of your computer </li>
    <li>delete the saved return no more than <strong>48 hours  after the transmission has been accepted</strong> by the CRA </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h3">Providing the tax return and forms </h2>
  <p>Although the CRA  encourages electronic filing, it also recognizes that you may need to provide  specific pages or a copy of the tax return to an individual. You can either  save them as a PDF or print them for the individual. Refer to <a href="../navigating-through/review.html">Finalizing and sending the return</a> under the CVITP tax  software overview. </p>

<p> If you print tax  returns or other documents containing the individual's information using a  shared printer, ensure that you pick them up promptly. Do not leave them on the printer for others to see.</p>

<section class="mrgn-tp-md">
<span class="pull-left mrgn-rght-md"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb fa-lg fa-fw"></i></span>

	<p>Some printers,    scanners, and copiers may retain memory. If you are using a personal printer that retains    memory, make sure you clear the memory regularly. If you are using a shared printer, your organization    will ensure that the memory is cleared regularly.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

  <h2 id="h4">Paper returns</h2>
  <p>If you prepare paper  returns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>add all box numbers for the same type of income  slips and enter the totals on the applicable lines on the paper return  (for example, add up the amounts in  box&nbsp;14 for all of an individual's T4&nbsp;slips and enter the total on  line&nbsp;10100) </li>
    <li>ensure the individual signs the tax return at the  bottom of page&nbsp;8 </li>
    <li>enter a 1 in box 48700 at the bottom of page&nbsp;8  of the tax return to indicate that it was prepared by a volunteer; this field  is automatically completed when the return is prepared using UFile CVITP </li>
    <li>attach all completed schedules, information slips,  required forms, and receipts </li>
    <li>instruct the individual to mail their paper return  to the <a href="../contacts-links.html" target="_blank">applicable tax centre</a></li>
    <li>remind the individual to mail their return by the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/covid-19-update/covid-19-filing-payment-dates.html" target="_blank">filing  deadline</a> to avoid possible late filing penalties or delays  in the processing of their benefit payments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an individual  wants to know when they can reasonably expect to receive their tax assessment  you can refer to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/service-standards-cra.html">service  standards in the CRA</a> for the most  current timeframes.</p>
