Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C1, Child Care Expense Deduction</h1>

        <p><strong>Series&nbsp;1: Individuals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Folio&nbsp;3: Family Unit Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Child Care Expense Deduction</strong></p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The purpose of the legislative provisions regarding child care expenses is to provide some relief for taxpayers who incur child care expenses in order to work, carry on a business or undertake certain educational activities. The maximum child care expenses that can be claimed per child each year is limited to <span class="nowrap">$5,000</span>, <span class="nowrap">$8,000</span> <span class="nowrap">or $11,000</span> depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>This Chapter discusses the meaning of child care expenses including the circumstances under which such expenses may be deducted. It comments on certain specific types of expenses and whether they qualify for deduction. It also discusses who is eligible to claim child care expenses and the limitations with respect to such claims. Examples are provided for lower and higher income taxpayers.</p>
<p>The CRA issues income tax folios to provide a summary of technical interpretations and positions regarding certain provisions contained in income tax law. Due to their technical nature, folios are used primarily by tax specialists and other individuals who have an interest in tax matters. While each paragraph in a chapter of a folio may relate to provisions of the law in force at the time&nbsp;it was written (see the <a href="#toc22">Application</a> section), the information provided is not a substitute for the law. The reader should, therefore, consider&nbsp;the chapter’s information in light of the relevant provisions of the law in force for the particular tax year being considered.</p>
<p>The CRA may have published additional guidance and detailed filing instructions on matters discussed in this Chapter and other topics that may be of interest. See the CRA’s <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications.html">Forms and publications</a> webpage for this and other topics that may be of interest.</p>

        <h3>What are child care expenses?</h3>
<p id="p1.1"><strong>1.1</strong> The term child care expense is defined in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span>. In general terms, the definition provides that a child care expense is an expense incurred for the purpose of providing child care services for an eligible child of a taxpayer, to enable the taxpayer or a supporting person to undertake specific activities. The taxpayer or supporting person must have resided with the eligible child at the time the expense was incurred in order for the expense to qualify as a child care expense. The requirements in definition are discussed below under the following headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eligible child <span class="nowrap">(see ¶1.3 to 1.8)</span>;</li>
<li>Expenses to enable the undertaking of specific activities <span class="nowrap">(see </span>¶<a href="#p1.9">1.9</a>&nbsp; <span class="nowrap">to 1.12);</span> and</li>
<li>Provider of child care services <span class="nowrap">(see </span>¶<a href="#p1.13">1.13</a>&nbsp; <span class="nowrap">to 1.19).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> There are some expenses that might otherwise be child care expenses but that are specifically excluded from the definition of child care expense. These types of expenses are discussed at ¶<a class="nowrap" href="#p1.20">1.20</a>.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Eligible child</h4>
<p id="p1.3"><strong>1.3</strong> As noted in ¶1.1, child care expenses must be incurred in respect of an eligible child of the taxpayer. An <strong>eligible child</strong> of a taxpayer for a <span class="nowrap">tax year</span> is defined in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span> to mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>child</strong> of the taxpayer or of the taxpayer's <strong>spouse</strong> or <strong><span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner</strong>; or</li>
<li>a child who is dependent on the taxpayer or on the taxpayer's spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law partner</span> for support and whose income for the year does not exceed the basic personal amount for the year as provided in paragraph&nbsp;(c) of the description <span class="nowrap">of B</span> in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;118(1)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/adjustment-personal-income-tax-benefit-amounts.html#nrtc-bpa">Basic personal amount</a> in the CRA’s indexation chart.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong> In addition, the child must either be:</p>
<ul>
<li>under 16 years of age at some time in the year; or</li>
<li>dependent on the taxpayer or on the taxpayer's spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner and have a mental or physical infirmity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.5</strong> Subsection&nbsp;252(1) provides an extended meaning of the term <strong>child</strong> for the purposes of the Act. Under this subsection, a child of a taxpayer includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a person of whom the taxpayer is the legal parent;</li>
<li>a person who is wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has, or immediately before the person attained the age&nbsp;of&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">19 years</span> had, in law or in fact, the custody and control;<br>
</li>
<li>a child of the taxpayer's spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner; and</li>
<li>a spouse or common-law partner of a child of the taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p1.6"><strong>1.6</strong> The term <strong>spouse</strong> refers exclusively to a person who is legally married to the taxpayer. <span class="nowrap">Subsection&nbsp;252(3)</span>, which extends the meaning of the term spouse to include individuals who are parties to a void or voidable marriage, does not apply for purposes of the child care expense deduction rules in <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;63</span>.</p>
<p id="p1.7"><strong>1.7</strong> The term <strong>common-law partner</strong> in respect of a taxpayer is defined in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;248(1)</span> and at a particular time includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a person who at that time cohabits in a conjugal relationship with the taxpayer and has done so throughout the&nbsp;continuous 12-month period that ends at that time; and</li>
<li>a person who at that time cohabits in a conjugal relationship with the taxpayer and is the parent of a child of the taxpayer for one of the following reasons:<ul>
<li>the person is the legal parent of the child; or</li>
<li>the child is wholly dependent on the person for support and the person has, in law or in fact, the custody and control of the child (or did immediately before the child <span class="nowrap">turned 19</span>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.8</strong> Under the definition of common-law partner, once individuals begin to cohabit in a conjugal relationship they are deemed to continue cohabiting in that conjugal relationship until they live separate and apart for a period of <span class="nowrap">90 consecutive</span> days because of a breakdown of their conjugal relationship. After this <span class="nowrap">90-day</span> period has passed, the effective day of the change of marital status is the date the individuals started living separate and apart.</p>

        <h4>Expenses to enable the undertaking of specific activities</h4>
<p id="p1.9"><strong>1.9</strong> The definition of <strong>child care expense</strong> in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span> requires that the expense be incurred to enable the taxpayer or a <strong>supporting person</strong> who resided with the eligible child at the time the expense was incurred, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>perform&nbsp;the duties of an office or employment;</li>
<li>carry on a business either alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business;</li>
<li>carry on research or any similar work for which the taxpayer or supporting person received a grant; or</li>
<li>attend a secondary school or designated educational institution (see Income Tax Folio S1-F2-C1, Qualifying Student and the Education and Textbook Tax Credits for the definition of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-2-students/income-tax-folio-s1-f2-c1-education-textbook-tax-credits.html#p1.9">designated educational institution</a>) where the taxpayer is enrolled in a <span class="nowrap"><strong>full-time</strong></span> or <strong><span class="nowrap">part-time</span> educational program</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="p1.10"></span><strong>1.10</strong> A <strong>supporting person</strong> of an eligible child of a taxpayer for a tax year is defined in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span> to mean an individual who resided with the taxpayer at any time during the year and at any time within <span class="nowrap">60 days</span> after the end of the year and who is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the child's parent <span class="nowrap">(paragraph&nbsp;252(2)(a)</span> provides an extended meaning of parent for the purposes of the Act);</li>
<li>the taxpayer's spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner; or</li>
<li>any other individual who was able to claim a tax credit under <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;118</span> for the child for the year.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p1.11"><strong>1.11</strong> A <strong>full-time educational program</strong> is one that lasts at least three consecutive weeks and requires that each student in the program spend at least <span class="nowrap">10 hours</span> per week on courses or work in the program. A <strong><span class="nowrap">part-time</span> educational program</strong> is one that lasts at least three consecutive weeks and requires that each student in the program spend at least <span class="nowrap">12 hours</span> per month on courses.</p>
<p><strong>1.12</strong> Fees paid to maintain a place in a day nursery or to ensure babysitting services are retained when the taxpayer or supporting person takes a temporary leave of absence from employment (for example, maternity leave) may be considered expenses incurred to enable the taxpayer or supporting person to perform&nbsp;the duties of an office or employment. The taxpayer or supporting person taking the leave must remain employed during the temporary leave of absence and the payments must be made with the eventual aim of enabling the taxpayer or supporting person to return to work with the same employer.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Provider of child care services</h4>
<p id="p1.13"><strong>1.13</strong> Under the definition of child care expense in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span>, the expense must be incurred for the purpose of providing child care services in Canada (<span class="nowrap">see </span>¶<a class="nowrap" href="#p1.19">1.19</a> for exceptions), for an eligible child of the taxpayer. This includes payments to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>eligible child care provider</strong>;</li>
<li>a day nursery school or day-care centre;</li>
<li>a day camp or <strong>day sports school</strong>;</li>
<li>a boarding school or camp (including a sports school where lodging is involved); and</li>
<li>an <strong>educational institution</strong> for the purpose of providing child care services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.14</strong> The above is not an exhaustive list of deductible child care expenses. For example, advertising expenses and placement agency fees incurred to locate a child care provider and mandatory registration fees may also qualify as child care expenses. In each case, the requirements in the definition of child care expense in <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(3)</span>, as explained <span class="nowrap">in </span>¶<a class="nowrap" href="#p1.1">1.1</a> <span class="nowrap">and </span>¶1.2 must also be met.</p>
<p><strong>1.15</strong> The term <strong>eligible child care provider</strong> refers to an individual or organization providing child care services. Where the child care services are provided by an individual, the individual must be a person other than:</p>
<ul>
<li>the father or mother of the <a href="#p1.3">eligible child</a>;</li>
<li>a <a href="#p1.10">supporting person</a> of the eligible child;</li>
<li>a person in respect of whom the taxpayer or a supporting person of the eligible child has deducted a tax credit under <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;118</span> for the year; or</li>
<li>a person who is under <span class="nowrap">18 years</span> of age and related to the taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.16</strong> <span class="nowrap">Paragraph&nbsp;251(2)(a)</span> provides that individuals are related if they are connected by blood relationship, marriage, <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partnership or adoption.<span class="nowrap"> Subsection&nbsp;251(6)</span> defines a connection by blood relationship, marriage, <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partnership or adoption for the purposes of the Act. For example, a <span class="nowrap">brother-in-law</span> or <span class="nowrap">sister-in-law</span> of the taxpayer is related to the taxpayer under <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;251(6)</span>. However, a niece, nephew, aunt, or uncle is generally not considered to be related to the taxpayer. For further information on the criteria used to determine whether persons deal with each other at arm's length under the Act, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/series-1-individuals/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.17</strong> The term <strong>day sports school</strong> is intended to cover those day camps providing a sufficient degree of child care services. Where a child participates in a particular program that includes sports, there can be an element of education and perhaps training as well as an element of child care. However, in any particular case, it is a question of fact as to whether child care services can be regarded as having been provided or whether a program of training <span class="nowrap">and/or</span> education is essentially involved. With respect to any particular program, a degree of basic protection and safety (child care services) is normally involved although the program may also provide activities and instruction which enrich the program. In determining whether a particular sports program involves a sufficient degree of child care, some factors that would be considered are the age&nbsp;of&nbsp;the participating children, the instructors' qualifications, the extent that progress is measured and <span class="nowrap">goal-orientation</span> is involved, the time devoted to the program, the duration of the program and the training and educational facilities used. For example, sports day camps for young children are generally not of an ongoing nature and it is generally recognized that there is a sufficient degree of child care even though the program is enriched by sporting activities with instruction. On the other hand, children, particularly those who are older, may participate in a sports program that is ongoing for a lengthy period of time, the instructors have degrees or certificates in respect of physical education, progress is regularly monitored and is <span class="nowrap">goal-oriented</span>, and sophisticated training methods and facilities are used. In this type of scenario, it is our general view that education and training are essentially involved as opposed to child care.</p>
<p><strong>1.18</strong> An <strong>educational institution</strong> may offer child care as well as an educational program. An educational program is considered to be more <span class="nowrap">goal-oriented</span> than child care, with the child being expected to learn skills and progress through a planned program of instruction, whereas a child in a typical child care setting is not expected to achieve any specific educational goals. Where an educational institution provides both child care and an educational program, only the portion of the fees paid to the institution relating to child care (that is, supervision before and after classes or during the lunch period) may qualify as child care expenses. When payments are made to an educational institution for a child under the compulsory school age, the services being provided are generally considered child care rather than education unless the facts indicate otherwise.</p>
<p id="p1.19"><strong>1.19</strong> Generally, child care expenses must be incurred for child care services provided in Canada by a resident of Canada. However, there are two exceptions to this rule:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md">Under <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;64.1</span>, a taxpayer who is not physically present in Canada throughout all or a part of <span class="nowrap">a tax year</span>, but who nevertheless continues to be resident in Canada for income tax purposes (that is, a factual or a deemed resident of Canada), is not subject to the <strong>in Canada</strong> requirement while absent from Canada. Accordingly, provided the requirements of <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;63</span> are otherwise met, a taxpayer who is a resident of Canada for tax purposes but absent from Canada for all or part of a <span class="nowrap">tax year</span> may deduct payments made during the absence from Canada for child care services provided outside of Canada by a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada.</li>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md">In certain circumstances, <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(4)</span> deems amounts paid for child care services provided in the United States to a taxpayer residing in Canada near the <span class="nowrap">Canada-United</span> States border to be eligible child care expenses for the purposes of <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;63</span>. The child care services must be provided at a place that is closer to the taxpayer's principal place of residence by a reasonably accessible route, having regard to the circumstances, than any place in Canada where such child care services are available. <span class="nowrap">Subsection&nbsp;63(4)</span> does not apply to expenses paid for a child's attendance at a boarding school or camp outside Canada.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p1.22"><strong>1.22</strong> Subsection&nbsp;63(1) provides that an amount paid as, or on account of, <a href="#p1.1">child care expenses</a> incurred for services rendered in a <span class="nowrap">tax year</span> for an <a href="#p1.3">eligible child</a> may be deducted:</p>

        <h4>Income</h4>
<p id="p1.24"><strong>1.24</strong> In determining whether the taxpayer or the supporting person had the lower income for the year, <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(2)</span> provides that the calculation of incomes is to be done without reference to any otherwise allowable deductions for:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md">child care expenses under <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;63</span>;</li>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md">any benefit repayment payable under <a href="http://www.canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-1996-c-23/latest/sc-1996-c-23.html#PART_VII_BENEFIT_REPAYMENT_369325">Part VII of the Employment Insurance Act</a> on or before <span class="nowrap">April 30</span> of the following year and which is deductible for the <span class="nowrap">tax year</span> under <span class="nowrap">paragraph&nbsp;60(v.1);</span> or</li>

<p><strong>1.25</strong> For purposes of determining whether the taxpayer or the supporting person has the lower income for the year, it is the CRA’s view that income that is exempt from taxation under <span class="nowrap">section&nbsp;81</span> is not to be considered.

<p><strong>1.28</strong> Generally, where there is both a taxpayer and a supporting person for the year, the child care expenses to be claimed by either party may be paid by either party.

        <h4>Separation and shared custody</h4>
<p id="p1.33"><strong>1.33</strong> The situations in which a higher income <a href="#p1.6">spouse </a>or <a href="#p1.7">common-law partner</a> may be able to claim child care expenses in the year of separation, where there has been a breakdown in the marriage or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partnership and there has been a reconciliation within <span class="nowrap">60 days</span> after the end of the year, are discussed <span class="nowrap">at ¶1.31</span>. If, in the year of separation, reconciliation does not occur within <span class="nowrap">60 days</span> after the end of the year, there will not be a supporting person for the year. In this case, child care expenses will be allowed only to the individual who resided with the eligible child and only to the extent that the expenses were paid by that individual to enable the individual to engage in one of the activities listed <span class="nowrap">in </span>¶<a class="nowrap" href="#p1.9">1.9</a> <span class="nowrap">.</span></p>
<p><strong>1.34</strong> In situations where there is no supporting person of the eligible child for the year, and the child lived with each parent at different times in a year (for example, in shared custody situations), both parents may claim a deduction for the year as provided in ¶1.38<span class="nowrap"> </span>to 1.42. Each parent may only claim child care expenses incurred for a period during the year that the eligible child resided with the parent and only to the extent that the expenses were paid by that parent to enable that parent to engage in the activities listed in ¶1.9. In these cases, the CRA will generally consider each parent to reside with a child while the child is in their custody.</p>
<p><strong>1.35</strong> In shared custody situations, one parent (the <strong>first parent</strong>) may pay the child care provider and be reimbursed for a portion of the child care costs by the other parent (the <strong>second parent</strong>). In these cases, the child care provider should issue a receipt to the first parent for the full amount of the payment for child care expenses. The first parent should issue a receipt to the second parent for the amount of the reimbursement. The first parent is generally considered to have paid child care expenses in the amount they paid the child care provider, net of the reimbursement received from the second parent. The second parent is generally considered to have paid child care expenses in the amount of the reimbursement they paid to the first parent. This will not be the case however, where the reimbursement is a <strong>support payment</strong> that must be included in the income of the first parent and that is deductible in computing the taxable income of the second parent. A reimbursement that must be included in the first parent’s income will not reduce the amount of the child care expenses that can be claimed by that parent. Where the amount of the payment made by the second parent to the first parent is a support payment that is deductible in computing the second parent’s income, the payment would not be considered a child care expense paid by the second parent. For assistance in determining whether a payment is considered a <strong>support payment</strong> and whether it is taxable to the recipient and deductible to payer, please refer to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-3-family-unit-issues/income-tax-folio-s1-f3-c3-support-payments.html">Income Tax <span class="nowrap">Folio S1-F3-C3</span>, Support Payments</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.36</strong> The comments in ¶1.33 <span class="nowrap">to 1.35</span> assume that neither parent is residing with a new supporting person during the year. If a parent remarries or enters into a new <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> relationship with another person in circumstances such that the other person is a supporting person, the new supporting person may be the one entitled to deduct child care expenses.</p>

<p>In either of these cases, the amount deductible by a taxpayer in any particular year is limited to the least of two amounts.</p>
<p>The <strong>first amount</strong> is the amount paid by the taxpayer or supporting person as or on account of child care expenses incurred for services rendered in the year, and that is not already included as an amount deductible under <span class="nowrap">subsection&nbsp;63(1)</span> by an individual other than the taxpayer.

<p class="mrgn-lft-xl,">The <strong>second amount</strong> is the amount, if any, determined by the formula:</p>
