	<h3>Exception<br />

</h3>
	<p>You have to estimate the amount of your taxable sales, leases or other supplies in Canada. Security is <strong>not</strong> required if your estimate is $100,000 annually or less and your annual net tax will be between $3,000 remittable and $3,000 refundable.<br />
</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>The security deposit would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the first year the amount of security is 50% of your <strong>estimated</strong> net tax, whether positive or negative, during the 12-month period after you register</li>
<li>for the following years, the amount of security is 50% of your <strong>actual</strong> net tax, whether positive or negative, for the last <span class="nowrap">12-month</span> period</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum security would be $1 million. The minimum is $5,000.</p>
<p>Your security may be in the form of <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>cash</li>
<li>certified cheque</li>
<li>money order</li>
<li>a qualifying bond</li>
</ul>
<p>Cash or cash equivalents (such as a certified cheque or a money order) may be used to pay other outstanding debts to the CRA at the time the security is released. CRA does not accept non-transferable bonds such as Canada Savings Bonds.

</summary>
        
    

    
        <p>A driver who supplies taxable commercial ride-sharing services is deemed to be a taxi business for GST/HST purposes and has to register and charge GST/HST on their fares in the same manner as taxi operators.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are a self-employed taxi driver or commercial ride-sharing driver, you have to<strong> </strong>register for the GST/HST even if you are a small supplier. You are usually self-employed if you are in <strong>one </strong>of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You own your taxicab/motor vehicle</li>
<li>You lease a taxicab/motor vehicle from an owner for a flat fee, either on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis</li>
<li>You lease the taxicab/motor vehicle from an owner for a percentage of fares</li>
</ul>
<p>Your effective date of registration is the day you start supplying taxable passenger transportation services</p>
<p>To find out if you are self-employed or an employee, you can request a ruling to have your status determined by using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt1.html"><span class="nowrap">Form CPT1</span>, Request for a CPP/EI Ruling – Employee or Self-Employed?</a>.</p>
