<p>Registering for a <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> program account will get you a <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr> if you don't already have one. If you already have a <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>, the program account will be <strong>added</strong> to your <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>.

  <!--<h2 id="h-3">When you need a CRA program account</h2>
  <p>Depending on your business  activities, you may need to register for certain program accounts to interact  with the CRA. Each CRA program account has its own rules and registration  requirements. You must review these to determine what you need for your business  and your obligations once you've registered.</p>
  <p>Your business number is the  unique standard identifier for your business and makes up a part of your CRA  program account number. You can only have one BN for your business or legal  entity.</p>
  <p>If you already have a business  number (BN), you will be asked for your BN when you register for a CRA program  account. Once you've registered for the program account, it will be added to  your existing BN. </p>-->

	 
  <h2 id="h-1">Understand CRA program account numbers </h2>
	<p>When you register for CRA program accounts such as GST/HST or payroll, a program identifier and reference number is added to your existing business number (BN). Together they become your CRA program account numbers and are used to report your business activities to the CRA. </p>
	
	<p>If you do not have a BN, you can get a one when you register for a CRA program account. <p>

	<p>A CRA program account number consists of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your unique 9-digit business number (BN)</li>
    <li>A 2-letter program identifier to indicate the program account type</li>
    <li>A 4-digit reference number to identify specific program accounts of the same type</li>
  </ul>

  <!--p>Each CRA program account has its own rules and requirements about when you need to register.</p>

    <summary>Example - Program account numbers for GST/HST and payroll</summary>
    <p>Kai started a business this year selling the jewellery they designed. Sales this year are over $30,000 and they need determined they meet the requirements to register for a GST/HST account.</p>
	  <p>Since Kai does not have a business number, they will get one when they register for a GST/HST account: </p>

      <li><strong>123456789 RT 0001</strong> - GST/HST program account number</li>
      
    </ul>
	  <p>A few months later, Kai hired an employee. Since Kai already received a BN when they registered for a GST/HST account, the same BN is used to register for a payroll deductions account:</p>
