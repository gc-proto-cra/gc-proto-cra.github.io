        <h2>What's new?</h2>
<p>We have revised the guide to reflect the changes made to the T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) Expenditures Claim Form, to ensure that the content is consistent with the SR&amp;ED policy papers, and SR&amp;ED Program forms and publications. We have added in Part 6, box 758 “Overhead and other expenditures in the tax year.” See the description in this guide under box 758. This information is required for tax year ends after 2020, and optional for tax year ends before 2021.</p>

        <h3>Changes to Form T661</h3>
<p>You can submit the T661(15) version of the form until December 31, 2020. Starting January 1, 2021, we will accept only the T661(20) version of the form for all tax years.</p>
<p>We have removed lines 350, 355, and 390 in Part 3, Section B, as lease costs for equipment and capital expenditures can no longer be claimed.</p>
<p>In Part 4, we have removed all lines related to qualified capital expenditures as capital expenditures no longer earn investment tax credits. The removed lines include 496, 510, 512, 514, 516, 518, 532, 535, 540, 543, and 546. In addition, we have removed line 504, expenditures on shared-use equipment (SUE), as SUE can no longer be claimed as qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures. We have removed the subtotal line associated with lines 557 and 558 as it is no longer required. We have modified line 528 to ensure that only 80% of amounts in respect of an SR&amp;ED contract to a person or partnership that is not a taxable supplier is included on line 528 since the remaining 20% of these amounts is included on line 529.</p>
<p>In Part 6, we have introduced a new box 758 that must be filled if traditional method is used. The information is required for tax year ends after 2020, and optional for tax year ends before 2021.</p>

        <h3><strong>Changes to the Guide to Form T661</strong></h3>
<p>We have revised the guide to remove all unnecessary references to expenditures of a capital nature and all references applicable before 2014 to reflect the changes to Form T661, which are outlined above.</p>
<p>We have removed all references and instructions for lines 510, 540, and 546 as the related forms, T1145 and T1146 have been edited to remove all references to capital expenditures.</p>
<p>We have added instructions related to new Box 758 – Overhead and other expenditures, for amounts that must be filled for each project if the traditional method is chosen. The information is required for tax year ends after 2020, and optional for tax year ends before 2021.</p>

        <h3>Advisory services and tools</h3>
<p>We provide a number of free advisory services to increase the awareness of the program requirements and to assist SR&amp;ED claimants in filing their SR&amp;ED claims.</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-lg"><strong>Pre-Claim Consultation</strong><br>
The Pre-Claim Consultation is a free on-demand service that potential claimants can use to find out whether their work qualifies for scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED) tax incentives before they submit an SR&amp;ED claim.<br><strong>Pre-Claim Review</strong><br>
The Pre-Claim Review is a free, on-demand review. It gives businesses a determination on how much of their research and development (R&amp;D) work is eligible and what expenditures qualify for the SR&amp;ED tax incentives, before they file their claim.<br><strong>First-Time Claimant Advisory Service </strong><br>
First-Time Claimant Advisory Service (FTCAS) is a free in-person service that provides first-time SR&amp;ED claimants with an opportunity to meet with CRA staff.<br><strong>Information seminars and webinars&nbsp;</strong><br>
Our free information sessions give you an overview of the program, discuss the eligibility criteria and which expenditures qualify, explain how to file an SR&amp;ED claim, and more.<br><strong>SR&amp;ED Self-Assessment and Learning Tool </strong><br>
The Self-Assessment and Learning Tool (SALT) helps claimants better understand the eligibility requirements of the SR&amp;ED program.<br><strong>Resolving Claimants' SR&amp;ED Concerns </strong><br>
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is committed to providing fair treatment to all claimants of the SR&amp;ED program. If you do not agree with the findings of the review of your SR&amp;ED claim, or if you have any concerns with how the review was conducted, you are encouraged to take specific steps to resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to use these services, which are available through CRA tax services offices across the country.

        <h3>The SR&amp;ED Program provides two incentives</h3>
<ol>
<li>You can deduct SR&amp;ED expenditures to reduce your income for tax purposes in the current tax year or carry these expenditures forward to reduce your income for tax purposes in future tax years.</li>
<li>You can receive an SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credit (ITC)</a> on qualified expenditures in the form of a cash refund or a reduction of tax payable or both. An unused SR&amp;ED ITC can be carried back 3 years or carried forward 20 years.</li>
</ol>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Filing requirements</h3>
<p>To access the two incentives for your SR&amp;ED work performed, you must complete and submit the following forms containing the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prnfrm">prescribed information</a> by your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srdrprtng">SR&amp;ED reporting deadline</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Form T661; and</li>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Schedule T2SCH31</a> for corporations or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form&nbsp;T2038(IND)</a> for individuals, as applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above forms and schedule should be filed with your income tax return for the year. If you are amending any of the above forms and schedules and want to file electronically, they must be filed with an income tax return for the year.</p>
<p>A claimant's SR&amp;ED reporting deadline is the day that is 12&nbsp;months after the filing due date of the income tax return for the year. This means that corporations have 18&nbsp;months and individuals have 17.5 months from the end of the tax year in which the expenditures were incurred to file an SR&amp;ED claim.</p>
<p>If you do not report an expenditure on Form T661 by the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline, you will not be entitled to receive the SR&amp;ED incentives for that expenditure. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Minister has extended certain SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines that occurred from March 13, 2020 until December 30, 2020. Details of the extensions can be found at <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/whats-new-program/reporting-deadline-extentions.html">Canada.ca/sred-deadlines</a>.</p>
<p>A corporation exempt from tax that incurs SR&amp;ED expenditures has to file Form T661 on or before the due date for filing its return of income for the year or it will be subject to a penalty. The filing due date is six months after the end of the corporation's tax year.</p>
<p>If you use CRA-approved commercial software to prepare your income tax return, you can submit your SR&amp;ED claim electronically with your income tax return. If you do not have access to CRA-approved commercial software, you can use forms and schedules printed off the CRA website to file your SR&amp;ED claim.</p>

Ensure all items listed in Part 8 – Claim checklist of Form T661 have been completed and filed with your income tax return by the reporting deadline. Filing a form or schedule with missing information, or using a previous version of Form&nbsp;T661 to file a current-year claim, may delay the processing of your claim, and some or all of your expenditures may be denied if the relevant prescribed information is not included on the form by the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srdrprtng">SR&amp;ED reporting deadline</a>.</li>
<li>For a partnership, Form T661 should be filed with the partnership information return no later than 12 months after the earliest of all filing due dates for the return of income of the members for the tax year in which the partnership's fiscal period ends. Each member would then be able to meet the deadline to claim the SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credit(ITC)</a> allocated to them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tick the appropriate box on your income tax return requesting a direct deposit of your refundable SR&amp;ED investment tax credit (ITC), if applicable.</li>
<li>File your SR&amp;ED claim by the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline at the appropriate tax centre. A list of the CRA's tax centres is provided in the T1 and T2 guides.</li>
<li>Respond in a timely manner if we contact you for more information.</li>
<li>Complete Part 9 to include claim preparer information. If a claim preparer did not prepare or assist in the preparation of Form T661 complete only lines 935, 970, and 975 in Part 9.</li>
<li>Form T661 and Schedule T2SCH31 or Form T2038(IND) should be filed with your income tax return for the year. If you are amending any of these forms and schedules and want to file electronically, they must be filed with an income tax return for the year.</li>

        <h2>Part 2 – Project information</h2>
<p>You must complete this part for each project claimed for the tax year. If you wish, you can choose to submit this part for only the 20 largest projects in dollar value, at the time of filing.</p>
<p>However, the CRA may request this part for some, or all, of the remaining projects at a later time. Failure to provide this information will result in the disallowance of the expenditures claimed for the projects as SR&amp;ED expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>In this part of Form T661 you are asked to provide, on a project-by-project basis, information that establishes the nature of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd">scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED)</a> work. This information enables the CRA to carry out an initial review of the work that you are claiming. This initial review helps to establish, with reasonable confidence, how the claimed work meets the SR&amp;ED eligibility requirements. Establishing this confidence may allow the CRA to expedite the review and process the claim in a timely manner.</p>
<p>We recommend that personnel who are familiar with the scientific or technical content of the work you are claiming prepare this part of Form T661.</p>
<p><strong>SR&amp;ED Project</strong></p>
<p>An “SR&amp;ED project” must fall within the definition of SR&amp;ED contained in the Income Tax Act. An SR&amp;ED project comprises a set of interrelated activities that collectively are necessary to resolve the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty">scientific or technological uncertainties</a>&nbsp;in the attempt to achieve the specific <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt">scientific or technological advancement</a>s defined for the project. This is pursued through a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv">systematic investigation or search</a> in a field of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn">science</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy">technology</a> by means of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt">experiment</a> &nbsp;or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss">analysis</a> performed by <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfndv">qualified individuals</a>.</p>
<p>When you frame your descriptions of the claimed work, we recommend that you follow the above characteristics in defining your SR&amp;ED project. &nbsp;The CRA determines the eligibility of any project at the level necessary to properly recognize all the work required for the attempted scientific or technological advancement, including support work.</p>
<p><strong>References:</strong> Income Tax Act subsection 248(1); <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html">Eligibility of Work for SR&amp;ED Investment Tax Credits Policy</a></p>
<p><strong>Advantages of providing clear and concise information</strong></p>
<p>You must carefully consider your answers to the questions in this part in order to make them clear, concise, and to the point. This is your first opportunity to present the claimed work in the context of the SR&amp;ED program. Clear and concise descriptions of the work that directly address these questions will play an important role in the CRA deciding if further review of the claimed activities is needed. This could reduce or even eliminate the need for you to submit further information and, as a result, enable the CRA to expedite your claim. Descriptions that are vague, unnecessarily lengthy, or fail to address the questions in technical terms will increase the likelihood of a further review.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the number of words you can use when responding to the questions in Section B. Therefore, the answers should concentrate on the technical facts and should be in the technical language and style of those who did the actual work, or who understand and are familiar with the work.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Section A – Project identification</h3>
<p>In this section you must provide information on the project that will help the CRA to get an understanding of the nature and scope of the SR&amp;ED work you have performed.</p>
<p id="ln200"><strong>Line 200 – Project title</strong></p>
<p>Enter the title of the project. If you have a title and an identification code for the project, enter both.</p>
<p id="ln202"><strong>Line 202 – Project start date</strong></p>
<p>Enter the start date of the SR&amp;ED project. The start of the project is defined as the point at which scientific or technological uncertainties are identified and the work to resolve those uncertainties commences.</p>
<p id="ln204"><strong>Line 204 – Completion date</strong></p>
<p>Enter the completion date or expected completion date of the SR&amp;ED project. The completion date of the project is defined as the point at which you:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the scientific or technological advancement by resolving the associated uncertainties;</li>
<li>determined that the scientific or technological uncertainties cannot be resolved; or</li>
<li>terminated the project for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand that the eligibility of the work also ceases at that point.</p>
<p>If your project is ongoing at the end of the tax year, enter the expected completion date. If a project is temporarily stopped and is expected to resume at a future date, enter the date you expect the project to be completed. If you do not know when you are expected to resume the project, enter the date the project temporarily stopped.</p>
<p id="ln206"><strong>Line 206 – Field of science or technology code</strong></p>
<p>From the table in <a href="#toc30">Appendix 1</a>, select the field of science or technology that best describes the primary field in which the SR&amp;ED project was attempting to achieve an advancement.</p>
<p>Note that the primary field in which the SR&amp;ED project was attempting to achieve an advancement may not necessarily be the same as the field of science or technology of the company project or in which the company carries out its regular business.</p>
<p>The field of science and technology you enter on this line is used for statistical and resource management purposes only and not for the purpose of determining eligibility of the work.&nbsp; Appendix 1 is not an exhaustive list of all eligible fields of science or technology.</p>
<p id="ln208"><strong>Lines 208 and 210 – Continuation of a previously claimed project or a first claim for the project</strong></p>
<p>Indicate whether or not you made an SR&amp;ED claim for this project in any previous tax year. Select only one. If the project is a continuation from a predecessor company, and it is the first time you are making a claim, select line 210 (first claim for the project).</p>
<p><strong>Lines 218 to 221 – Work done jointly or in collaboration with other businesses</strong></p>
<p id="ln218"><strong>Line 218</strong> – Indicate whether any of the claimed SR&amp;ED project work was done jointly or in collaboration with other businesses. For example, your answer will be yes if the work was done as a joint effort, with or without a formal agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include contractors that performed some or all of the work. Information regarding contractors is requested on lines 267 to 269.</li>
<li>Do not include other parties that contracted you to perform SR&amp;ED work on their behalf. This information is requested on line 266.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ln220"><strong>Lines 220 and 221</strong></p>
<p>(Complete these lines only if you responded <strong>yes </strong>at line 218.)</p>
<p>Enter on line 220 the names of the businesses that performed SR&amp;ED work jointly or in collaboration with you. If available, list their corresponding business numbers (BNs) at line 221.</p>

        <h3>Section B – Project descriptions</h3>
<p>In this section you must provide technical details of your basic research, applied research, or experimental development project. Lines 242, 244, and 246 have word limitations of 350, 700, and 350 respectively. Therefore, your answers should focus on the technical facts and should be in the technical language and style of those who did the actual work, or who understand and are familiar with the work.</p>
<p>Use existing materials and documents generated during the course of your work to extract the pertinent information to complete this section. You should retain these materials and documents so that the CRA can verify that there is a reasonable level of support for the SR&amp;ED work that was performed in the tax year. (See <a href="#toc31">Appendix 2</a>, “Documentation and other evidence to support your SR&amp;ED claim.” The&nbsp; <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/self-assessment-learning-tool.html">Self-Assessment and Learning Tool (SALT) </a>&nbsp;might also be helpful in assisting you in identifying and gathering your SR&amp;ED project information.</p>
<p>If you are using approved tax software to prepare your income tax return, your responses to these questions for each project should be included in the software and should not be submitted as a separate attachment.</p>
<p>If you are not using approved tax software to prepare your claim, use a separate sheet if necessary to respond to these questions. Each separate sheet must be clearly labelled with the project title and the question you are answering.</p>
<p id="ln242"><strong>Line 242 – What scientific or technological uncertainties did you attempt to overcome?<br></strong> (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>Describe the scientific or technological uncertainty you encountered that led you to do the SR&amp;ED. Scientific or technological uncertainty means whether a given result or objective can be achieved or how to achieve it, is not known or determined on the basis of generally available scientific or technological knowledge or experience.</p>
<p>In responding to this question, we suggest that you include the objective of the project and describe the scientific knowledge or the new or improved capability you were seeking. Your response should indicate the existing <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl">scientific or technological knowledge base</a> at the onset of the SR&amp;ED project. Describe the shortcomings or limitations of that knowledge base that prevented you from overcoming the scientific or technological uncertainties identified. In other words, your response should describe how the uncertainties could not be resolved on the basis of generally available scientific or technological knowledge or experience.</p>

<p id="ln244"><strong>Line 244 – What work did you perform in the tax year to overcome the scientific or technological uncertainties described in line 242?<br></strong> (Maximum 700 words)</p>
<p>In responding to this question, describe, in a clear and concise manner, how you attempted to overcome the scientific or technological uncertainties that you identified at line 242.</p>
<p>Describe the work done in chronological order. In doing so, clearly demonstrate the systematic nature of the investigation or search. This includes describing;</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss">hypotheses</a> designed to reduce or eliminate the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty">uncertainties</a>;</li>
<li>experiments and/or analysis conducted to test the hypotheses;</li>
<li>the results obtained; and,</li>
<li>the conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a continuation of a previously claimed project, it is important that you focus on the work carried out during the tax year for which you are making the claim.</p>
<p>If all or part of the work was performed on your behalf by contractors, include that work in your description and identify that the work was performed by contractors.</p>

<p id="ln246"><strong>Line 246 – What scientific or technological advancements did you achieve or attempt to achieve as a result of the work described in line 244?<br></strong> (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>Describe the new scientific knowledge you gained or the technological advancements you achieved, or attempt to achieve, as a result of the SR&amp;ED work you performed.</p>
<p>Note that it is the advancement in the underlying science or technology that is important, not how the work advanced your business or business practices.</p>
<p>In responding to this question, we suggest that you focus on how the work you described at line 244 advanced the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl">scientific or technological knowledge base</a> that existed at the onset of the project. In other words, describe the information or the knowledge generated that advanced your understanding of scientific relations or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy">technology</a>.</p>

        <p>Achieving the novelty, innovation, uniqueness, feature enhancement, or increased functionality of the product or process may not in itself demonstrate scientific or technological advancement.

        <h2>Part 3 – Calculation of SR&amp;ED expenditures</h2>
<p>In this part you determine how much you spent on the SR&amp;ED work performed in the year. Part&nbsp;3 of the form is divided into three sections.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Section A – Select the method to calculate the SR&amp;ED expenditures</h3>
<p>In this section you have to select the method you will be using to calculate the SR&amp;ED expenditures. You can either elect to use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#pmthd">proxy method</a> or choose to use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tmthd">traditional method</a>. You have to select one method for each tax year for which you want to claim SR&amp;ED expenditures. It is important to note that your selection cannot be changed for the tax year once your form T661 is filed.</p>
<p>The traditional method involves specifically identifying and claiming all <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#vrhd">overhead and other expenditures</a> you incurred for SR&amp;ED during the tax year. The proxy method provides an alternative method to computing overhead and other expenditures that results in a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prprxy">prescribed proxy amount (PPA)</a>. The PPA is not included in the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#plddct">pool of deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures</a>, and you do not deduct it when calculating income. However, you can earn an SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credit (ITC)</a> on the PPA since&nbsp;it forms part of the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfsrd">qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures</a> for SR&amp;ED ITC purposes. (Refer&nbsp;to <a href="#toc19">Part&nbsp;4</a>.)</p>
<p>Before selecting the method, refer to <a href="#tlb1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#tlb2">Table 2</a> which show how to treat expenditures under each method.</p>
<p><strong>Lines 160 and 162 – Select the method</strong></p>
<p id="ln160"><strong>Line 160 – </strong>Tick this box if you elect to use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#pmthd">proxy method</a> to calculate your SR&amp;ED expenditures. Complete Part 5, and enter &quot;0&quot; on line 360.</p>
<p id="ln162"><strong>Line 162 – </strong>Tick this box if you choose to use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tmthd">traditional method</a>&nbsp;to calculate your SR&amp;ED expenditures. Ideally, you would have to support for the SR&amp;ED portion of overhead and other expenditures by project claimed so that you can enter the total on line 360. Do not complete Part&nbsp;5, and enter “0” on line 502.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Determine the portion of salary or wages and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbnfts">taxable benefits</a> you paid to your employees other than <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spcfd">specified employees</a> who are <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nggd">directly engaged in SR&amp;ED</a> for work performed outside Canada. Refer to line 300 for examples of how to calculate the portion of salary or wages.</p>
<p>The salary or wages that you can claim for SR&amp;ED work performed outside Canada must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>the SR&amp;ED work was directly undertaken by an employee and not performed by a contractor;</li>
<li>the employee who performed the SR&amp;ED work was a resident of Canada at the time the expense was incurred;</li>
<li>the work was <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rbsnss">related to a business of the claimant</a>;</li>
<li>the SR&amp;ED work carried on by the employee outside Canada was an integral part and solely in support of the SR&amp;ED work for a project carried on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncnd">in Canada</a>; and</li>
<li>the salary or wages paid were not subject to income or profits tax from another country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amount B</strong> – 10% of the total of SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#swgs">salary or wages</a> for SR&amp;ED performed in Canada.</p>
<p>This limit is calculated as 10% of line 306, which is the total salary or wages claimed for SR&amp;ED performed in Canada.</p>

<p>A third-party payment is generally a payment that you made to an approved association, university, college, research institute, or other similar institution. In some cases a payment to a Canadian corporation resident in Canada could also be considered a third-party payment.&nbsp;A third-party payment must be for SR&amp;ED work carried out <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncnd">in Canada</a> that is <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rbsnss">related to your business</a>, and you must be entitled to exploit the results of the SR&amp;ED. Third-party payments refer to amounts paid for SR&amp;ED not directly undertaken by you or on your behalf. For a list of the approved entities, consult Appendix A of the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/third-party-payments-policy.html">Third-Party Payments Policy</a>. If an entity is not listed in Appendix A, contact the entity in question with respect to their status as an approved entity.</p>
<p>A third-party payment of the claimant made to an SR&amp;ED performer must be reduced by any related expenditure of the SR&amp;ED performer that is for capital property, or the use of, or the right to use, capital property (if the capital property were owned by the SR&amp;ED performer).</p>
<p>If you made a third-party payment, you must complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1263.html">Form T1263, Third-Party Payments for Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED</a>), for each payment and attach it to Form T661.

        <h2>Part 9 – Claim preparer information</h2>
<p>In this part, you must provide the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prnfrm">prescribed information</a> on each <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> that has accepted consideration to prepare or assist in the preparation of this SR&amp;ED claim.</p>
<p>A penalty of $1,000 may be assessed in respect of each SR&amp;ED claim for which prescribed information about the claim preparer(s) is missing, incomplete or inaccurate. If a claim preparer has prepared or assisted in the preparation of the claim, the claim preparer will be jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable with the claimant for the penalty.</p>
<p id="ln935"><strong>Line 935 - Was a claim preparer engaged in any aspect of the preparation of this SR&amp;ED claim?</strong></p>
<p>Tick box 1 if a claim preparer was engaged in any way in the preparation of this claim and complete the Claim preparer information table. If no claim preparer was engaged for this claim, check box 2 and complete lines 970 and 975.</p>
<p id="CLMPPR">Claim preparer means a person or partnership that has accepted consideration to prepare or assist in the preparation of the form but does not include an employee who prepares or assists in the preparation of the form in the course of performing their duties of employment.</p>
<p id="ln940"><strong>Line 940 – Name of claim preparer (company or individual)</strong></p>
<p>Enter the name of the <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a>. If there is more than one, enter the name of each claim preparer on a separate line. Enter the name of the claim preparer on multiple lines if that claim preparer has a mixed billing arrangement or a contingency fee arrangement with variable rates. See example below.</p>
<p id="ln945"><strong>Line 945 – Business number</strong></p>
<p>Enter the business number (BN) of the <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> listed in column 940. Make sure that you enter all fifteen characters of the BN. For individuals you may provide the GST or HST number.</p>

<p>Enter the type of billing arrangement code for the <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> as described in Part 9 in the list of Billing arrangement codes. For example, if the billing was based on a contingency fee as a percentage of the investment tax credit earned, enter code 1. If the claim preparer used a mixed billing arrangement, indicate the name of the claim preparer and each type of billing arrangement on separate lines. See example below.</p>
<p id="ln955"><strong>Line 955 – Billing rate</strong></p>
<p>Enter the billing rate for the arrangement. For example, if the <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> billed on a contingency fee basis (line 950, code 1) at a rate of 15.5% of the investment tax credit earned, enter 15.5. If you were billed at $75 per hour (line 950, code 2), enter 75. If a claim preparer used a contingency fee arrangement with a variable rate (increasing or decreasing), indicate the name of the claim preparer and the various rates on separate lines. See example below.</p>
<p id="ln960"><strong>Line 960 – Other billing arrangement(s)</strong></p>
<p>If a <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> used a billing arrangement other than those identified under Billing arrangement codes in Part 9, you must describe the billing arrangement in box 960 in 10 words or less.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="ln965"><strong>Line 965 – Total fee paid, payable or expected to pay</strong></p>

<p>The CRA requires Part 9 to be signed and dated by the individual, authorized signing officer of the corporation, or authorized partner who has certified that the <a href="#CLMPPR">claim preparer</a> information in Part 9 is complete and accurate. However, if you are filing your SR&amp;ED claim electronically, three items of identification—the Business Number, tax year end, and web access code or EFILE online number and password—make up your electronic signature, which is considered official.</p>

        <h2>Partnerships</h2>
<p>There are special requirements that apply to partnerships that sometimes differ from the general requirements in this guide. This section outlines the information the CRA needs in order to process an SR&amp;ED claim when the SR&amp;ED is performed by a partnership. This section also provides a line-by-line explanation for each line item of Form T661 that differs from the general requirements in this guide.</p>
<p><strong>SR&amp;ED expenditures – Form T661</strong></p>
<p>A partnership's SR&amp;ED expenditures must be deducted in the calculation of the partnership's net income or loss in the tax year they are incurred. A partnership will not have a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#pl">pool</a> of SR&amp;ED expenditures to carry forward to future tax years, and the partners cannot include any portion of the partnership's SR&amp;ED expenditures in their <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#plddct">pool of deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures</a>. As a result, the partners do not include any of the partnership's SR&amp;ED expenditures when filing Form&nbsp;T661 with their corporate or individual income tax return.</p>
<p><strong>SR&amp;ED filing requirements for partnerships and partners</strong></p>
<p>The filing requirements of the partnerships and partners differ depending on whether or not a T5013-FIN partnership financial return is filed by the partnership. For a complete explanation of the requirements for&nbsp;filing the T5013-FIN, see Guide <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4068.html">T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return</a>.</p>
<p>Since the SR&amp;ED expenditures are deducted at the partnership level, the partnership should file Form T661. The SR&amp;ED expenditures on Form T661 are the total SR&amp;ED expenditures of the partnership, and not just a particular partner's share of those expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>If the T5013-FIN partnership financial return is filed or is required to be filed</strong>, the <strong>partnership</strong> should file the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form T661 of the partnership</li>
<li>the calculation and allocation of the SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credit (ITC)</a> of the partnership to its partners</li>
</ul>
<p>To facilitate processing, Form T661 should be filed with the partnership information return no later than 12 months after the earliest of all <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#flngd">filing-due-dates</a> for the return of income of the partners (members) for the tax year in which the partnership's fiscal period ends (refer to Guide <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4068.html">T4068, Guide for the T5013 Partnership Return</a>, for the filing due dates and requirements for partnerships).</p>
<p>A partner can file Form T661 on behalf of the partnership, but the SR&amp;ED claim will not be processed unless a partnership information return, which agrees with Form T661, has been filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>partners</strong> should file the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Schedule T2SCH31</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form T2038(IND)</a></li>
<li>Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5013.html">T5013, Statement of Partnership Income</a></li>
</ul>
<p>File your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Schedule T2SCH31</a> with your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form&nbsp;T2038(IND)</a> with your T1&nbsp;individual income tax and benefit return and Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5013.html">T5013, Statement of Partnership Income</a> at the tax centre that normally processes your return on or before the partners' respective <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srdrprtng">SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If the T5013-FIN partnership financial return is not required to be filed,</strong> the partnership does not need to file any documents.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>partners</strong> should submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form T661 for the partnership</li>
<li>financial statements of the partnership</li>
<li>the calculation and allocation of the SR&amp;ED ITC of the partnership to its partners</li>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form&nbsp;T2038(IND)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>File the above information with your T1 individual income tax and benefit return at the tax centre that normally processes your return on or before the partners' respective <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srdrprtng">SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines</a>.</p>

        <h2>Appendix 2 – Documentation and other evidence to support your SR&amp;ED claim</h2>
<p>It is important to maintain supporting evidence (for example, information, records, documentation) to substantiate that the scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED) work was performed and allowable expenditures have been incurred. The business environment in which SR&amp;ED is carried out will influence the nature and sources of evidence that are available to support the SR&amp;ED claim. If your SR&amp;ED claim is selected for review, you will be asked during the review to support your claim by providing supporting documentation that were generated as the SR&amp;ED was being carried out. Work for which you have no relevant supporting evidence will likely be disallowed.</p>
<p>The following sections are provided to help you identify the type of documents and other items the CRA reviewers generally consider as supporting evidence. However, the lack of detailed documentary information should not discourage you from making an SR&amp;ED claim or be considered as an indication that SR&amp;ED did not take place, particularly in the case of a first-time claimant. In such a case, the CRA should be consulted to help you identify other types of supporting evidence that could be used to support the SR&amp;ED work and the related expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the SR&amp;ED work claimed</strong></p>
<p>Most often, supporting evidence is in the form of contemporaneous documents (for example, documents generated as the SR&amp;ED was being carried out). In fact, contemporaneous documentation that is dated, signed, and specific to the work performed are the best supporting evidence that you can provide. If you choose to substantiate the work performed using other evidence, you must ensure that the evidence clearly addresses the questions in Part 2 of Form T661.</p>
<p>Table 1 in this appendix provides a list of examples of documentation and other items that you could use as supporting evidence. Note that the table is only meant to be a tool to help you identify the type of supporting evidence you have to support your claim and to organize your documentation should your claim be selected for review. It is important to note that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The table is <strong>not</strong> a checklist to determine the eligibility of work as SR&amp;ED. That is, the existence of supporting evidence as listed in the table does not by itself indicate the work is SR&amp;ED. It is the content of that supporting evidence that will determine if the evidence is relevant.</li>
<li>The table is not an exhaustive list—other forms of supporting evidence may be relevant.</li>
<li>It is <strong>not</strong> expected that all of the supporting evidence listed in the table would be generated for every SR&amp;ED project. However, some form of relevant supporting evidence must be available to address the questions in Part 2 of Form T661.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Supporting the SR&amp;ED expenditures claimed</strong></p>
<p>You are required to keep complete and organized records that support the expenditures claimed. Requirements for records needed to support financial transactions are set out on&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/keeping-records.html">the page canada.ca/taxes-records</a>. Typical financial records and documents that may be requested during the financial review include financial statements and records, ledgers, journals, and vouchers. Source documents such as receipts, contracts, and general correspondence may also be requested.</p>
<p>In addition to the above general financial records, SR&amp;ED claimants must keep any related documents and information to support the specific expenditures claimed on Form T661. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cost breakdowns per project for each line item in Part 3 of Section B of Form T661;</li>
<li>the cost allocation method used to allocate labour and overhead expenditures to SR&amp;ED;</li>
<li>time sheets that support the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#swgs">salary or wages</a> claimed by employees on SR&amp;ED activities;</li>
<li>contracts and/or agreements related to the SR&amp;ED claim;</li>
<li>logbooks or other documents that support the use of equipment for SR&amp;ED;</li>
<li>documents to support <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#thrdpp">third-party payments</a> such as to whom and for what the payments were made;</li>
<li>supporting schedules such as the reconciliation of amounts on Form T661 to the financial statements;</li>
<li>schedules to support the SR&amp;ED <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rcptr">investment tax credit (ITC) recapture</a> amount; and</li>
<li>provincial/territorial income tax returns, if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Maintaining appropriate supporting evidence will facilitate the review of your claim and help you to substantiate your claim. This is especially important in work environments where both SR&amp;ED and commercial work are taking place. For example, using the project records you have, you should be able to explain and/or demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>who did the work claimed and how much time employees spent on SR&amp;ED work;</li>
<li>how the work claimed was related to the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt">scientific or technological advancement</a> sought;</li>
<li>how materials were used, the quantities consumed or transformed in SR&amp;ED work, and how materials and products were ultimately disposed of;</li>
<li>in the case of contracts and/or agreements relating to claimed work, what services or products were provided, who performed the work, where the work took place, as well as who acquired rights to any intellectual property resulting from that work; and</li>
<li>how the project costs that are attributable to SR&amp;ED work are segregated from those that are for non-SR&amp;ED work, when the SR&amp;ED is carried out in a commercial environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table 1 – Examples of supporting evidence</strong> <strong>for SR&amp;ED work claimed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the Table</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The table is intended to help you identify evidence that supports each of your claimed projects. Therefore, you may wish to complete a table for each project.</li>
<li>The first column lists some examples of supporting evidence that you may have.</li>
<li>Each of the five remaining columns corresponds to questions from different lines in Part 2 of Form T661. For each column:<ul>
<li>Identify the supporting evidence you possess that best addresses the question in that column (for example, by placing a tick mark in the box). More than one type of supporting evidence could be ticked in each column. A shaded box means that generally this type of supporting evidence does not apply to the related lines in the corresponding column.</li>
<li>If you have supporting evidence that is not listed in the table, identify it in the row labelled &quot;Others.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This table is only intended to be an aid; you do not have to complete it or submit it with your claim. However, you may wish to keep it with your project records. Should your claim be selected for review, you will most likely be asked to provide the supporting evidence to the CRA reviewer. Completing the table may help both you and the CRA reviewer identify the supporting evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table provides examples of evidence to support SR&amp;ED work claimed.</p>
