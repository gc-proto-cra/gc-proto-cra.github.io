        <h2 id="P44_1110">What is a TFSA</h2>
<p>The TFSA program began in 2009. It is a way for individuals who are 18 years of age or&nbsp;older and who have a valid social insurance number (SIN) to set money aside tax-free throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p>Contributions to a TFSA are not deductible for income tax purposes. Any amount contributed as well as any income earned in the account (for example, investment income and capital gains) is generally <span class="nowrap">tax-free</span>, even when it is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Administrative or other fees in relation to a TFSA and any interest on money borrowed to contribute to a TFSA are not tax-deductible.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="P44_1113">Types of TFSAs</h2>
<p>There are three types of TFSAs that can be offered: a deposit, an annuity contract, and an arrangement in trust.</p>
<p>Banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and trust companies can all issue TFSAs.</p>
<p>For more information about a certain type of <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, contact a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>issuer.</p>

        <h2 id="P44_1111">Who can open a <abbr title="Tax-Free Savings Account">TFSA</abbr></h2>
<p>Any individual that is a resident of Canada who has a valid SIN and who is 18 years of age or older is eligible to open a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>.</p>
<p>Any individual that is a non-resident of Canada who has a valid SIN and who is 18 years of age or older is also eligible to open a TFSA. However, any contributions made while a non-resident will be subject to a 1% tax for each month the contribution stays in the account. For more information, see “<a href="#P44_1116">Non-residents of Canada</a>”.</p>
<p>You cannot open a TFSA or contribute to one until you turn 18. However, when you turn 18, you will be able to contribute up to the full TFSA dollar limit for that year.</p>

        <p>Brayden was eager to open his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, but he didn’t turn 18 until <span class="nowrap">December 21, 2022</span>. On J<span class="nowrap">anuary 4, 2023</span>, he opened a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>and contributed $12,500 ($6,000 for 2022 plus $6,500 for 2023 – the maximum <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>dollar limits for those years). On the advice of his broker, he had&nbsp;opened a self‑directed <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>and invested in stocks that increased in value. By the end of 2023, the value in Brayden’s <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>had increased to $12,800. Brayden was worried that for&nbsp;2024, he would only be able to contribute $6,700 (the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>dollar limit for&nbsp;2024 less the $300 increase in&nbsp;value in his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>t&nbsp;hrough 2023). Neither the earnings produced in the account nor the increase in its value will reduce the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room in the following year, so Brayden can contribute up to $7,000 in 2024 to his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>.</p>

        <p>Since opening her <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> in 2009, Jenny has contributed the maximum <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> dollar limit each year. At the end of 2023, she has no <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> contribution room left. In 2024, Jenny makes a $7,000 contribution, the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> dollar limit for 2024. Later that year, she withdraws $3,000 for a trip. Unfortunately, her plans change and she cannot go. There are choices Jenny could make regarding her <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> withdrawal as described below.</p>
<p>If Jenny wishes to re-contribute part or all of the $3,000 she withdrew, she will have to wait until the beginning of 2025 to do so. The $3,000 will be added to her <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> contribution room at the beginning of 2025.</p>
<p>If she re-contributes any of the withdrawn amount before 2025, she will have an excess amount in her <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> and will be charged a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> amount for each month that the excess stays in her account.</p>

<li>no <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room will accrue for any year throughout which you are a non-resident of Canada</li>
<li>any withdrawals made during the period that you were a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> will be added back to your <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room in the following year, but will only be available if you re-establish your Canadian residency status for tax purposes</li>

        <p>On <span class="nowrap">May&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2024</span>, Michel contributed $7,000 to his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>in Bank &quot;A&quot; leaving him with a remaining <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room of zero.</p>
<p>In July, he received his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>statement from Bank &quot;A&quot; which showed there was only a minimal growth ($25) from his investment.&nbsp;Michel decided to talk to other financial institutions to see if they could offer a better rate of return for his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>investment.&nbsp;Michel found a better rate offered at another financial institution and decided to transfer the funds from his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>account to Bank &quot;B&quot;.</p>
<p>For Michel's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contributions&nbsp;to be considered a qualifying transfer, with no tax consequences, Bank &quot;A&quot; <strong>must</strong> complete a direct transfer of funds to Bank &quot;B&quot;.</p>
<p>If, instead,&nbsp;Michel went into Bank &quot;A&quot; in July, and withdrew the amount in his <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>and walked into Bank &quot;B&quot; to open a new <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>with a contribution of $7,025, the contribution would be treated as an ordinary contribution and because his unused <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room was already zero, he would have an excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>amount of $7,025 and would have to pay a <span class="nowrap">1%</span> per month tax on the excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>amount for as long as the excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>amount remained in his account. The withdrawal from Bank &quot;A&quot; would be added back to his contribution room at the beginning of 2025.</p>
<p>In addition, if&nbsp;Michel left his contribution to Bank &quot;B&quot; in his&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>for the rest of the year, his tax would be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>highest excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>amount per month from July to December was $7,025</li>
<li>tax of 1% per month on the highest excess TFSA amount is $421.50 ($7,025 × 1%&nbsp;× 6 months)</li>

<p>If you are in this situation, you must meet both of the following conditions:</p>

</ul>
<p>When these conditions are met, the transfer is a qualifying transfer and will not reduce the recipient's eligible <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room.

        <p>This rule applies for all three types of TFSAs: deposit, annuity contract, and trust arrangement.</p>
<p>The deceased holder is not considered to have received an amount from the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>at the time of death if the holder named their <a href="#survivor">survivor</a> as the successor holder of the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>. In this situation, the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>continues to exist and the successor holder assumes ownership of the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contract and all of its contents. However, where the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contract is a trust arrangement, the trust continues to be the legal owner of the property held in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>continues to exist and both its value, at the date of the original holder's death, and any income earned after that date continue to be sheltered from tax under the new successor holder.</p>
<p>Except in cases where an excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>amount remained in the deceased holder's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>at the time of their death, the <a href="#successor_holder">successor holder</a>'s unused <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room is unaffected by their having assumed ownership of the deceased holder's account.</p>
<p>The issuer will notify us of this change in ownership.</p>
<p>The successor holder, after taking over ownership of the deceased holder's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, can make tax-free withdrawals from that account. The successor holder can also make new contributions to that account, depending on their own unused <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room.</p>
<p>If the successor holder already had their own <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, then they would be considered as the holder of two separate accounts. If they wish, they can <strong>directly transfer</strong> part or all of the value from one to the other (for example, to consolidate accounts). This would be considered as a qualifying transfer and would not affect available <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA </abbr>contribution room.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a survivor, designated as the successor holder of a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, could not have a valid Canadian social insurance number (SIN), which is one of the eligibility requirements for opening a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>. If the survivor is a Canadian resident, they should apply to <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/" rel="external">Service Canada</a> to get a valid Canadian <abbr title="Social insurance number">SIN</abbr>.</p>
<p>If the survivor is a non-resident, they should ask for an individual tax number from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> by completing <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">Form T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents</a>.</p>

        <p>Miriam and Pauline were a married couple. Each had available TFSA contribution room of&nbsp;$7,000 at the beginning of 2024. Miriam&nbsp;initially contributed&nbsp;$7,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline contributed&nbsp;$1,500 to hers. On June&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2024, Miriam contributed an additional&nbsp;$2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her&nbsp;total contributions for 2024 to&nbsp;$9,000.</p>
<p>As Miriam only had contribution room of&nbsp;$7,000 for 2024, she had an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,000. Miriam passed away on September&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2024, and the value of her TFSA on that date was&nbsp;$9,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor holder of&nbsp;her TFSA if she dies. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be considered a successor holder, she becomes the holder of the TFSA from September&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2024.</p>
<p>Since an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam’s TFSA at the time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, on October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2024, a&nbsp;$2,000 contribution to her TFSA (which is&nbsp;the excess amount in Miriam’s TFSA). As Pauline had only previously contributed $1,500 to her own TFSA, she still had unused TFSA contribution room for 2024 of $5,500. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA amount in her account.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are&nbsp;no tax consequences to Pauline based on this deemed contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2024 is&nbsp;$3,500. However, the legal&nbsp;representative of Miriam’s estate must file Form&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">RC243, Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return</a>, and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243-sch-a.html">Form&nbsp;RC243‑SCH‑A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts</a>, for the&nbsp;2024 tax year reporting the excess in Miriam’s TFSA for the period from June up to and including September&nbsp;2024.</p>

        <p>From the situation above, if Pauline had initially contributed&nbsp;$7,000 to her own TFSA on May&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2024, instead of the&nbsp;$1,500 previously noted, the&nbsp;$2,000 deemed contribution on October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2024, would have resulted in total contributions to her TFSA in 2024 of&nbsp;$9,000.</p>
<p>Pauline’s TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024 was&nbsp;$7,000. As&nbsp;a result of the deemed contribution, she would be considered to have an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,000&nbsp;($9,000-$7,000).

<p>Designated beneficiaries can include a <a href="#survivor">survivor</a> who has not been named as a successor holder, former spouses or common-law partners, children, a designated subsequent survivor holder who is the new spouse or common-law partner of the successor holder, and qualified donees.</p>
<p>A designated beneficiary will not have to pay tax on payments made out of the <abbr title="Tax-Free Savings Account">TFSA</abbr>, as long as the total payments do not exceed the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr>&nbsp;of all the property held in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> at the time of the holder's death.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries (other than a survivor) can contribute any of the amounts they receive to their own <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> as long as they have unused <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> contribution room available.</p>
<p>A survivor who is a beneficiary has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an <a href="#exempt">exempt contribution</a> to their own <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>. As long as they meet certain conditions and limits, this transaction will not affect their own unused <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> contribution room. For more information, see <a href="#designation_survivor">Designation of an exempt contribution by a survivor</a>.</p>
<p>If, at the time of death, there was an <a href="#excess">excess TFSA amount</a> in the deceased holder’s <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, a tax of 1% per month is payable on the highest excess amount for each month the excess stayed, up to and including the month of death. The legal representative must file <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html"><span class="nowrap">Form RC243</span>, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return</a>, and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243-sch-a.html"><span class="nowrap">Form RC243-</span>SCH-A, Schedule A&nbsp;– Excess TFSA Amounts</a>.</p>
<p>If no successor holder or beneficiary is designated in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> contract or will, the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> property is directed to the deceased holder's estate and distributed in accordance with the terms of the deceased holder's will.</p>
<h3 id="rules_annuity">General rules&nbsp;– Deposit or annuity contract</h3>
<p>If there is no successor holder, the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> ceases to exist when the holder of a deposit or an annuity contract under a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> dies. The holder is considered to have disposed of the contract or the deposit immediately before the time that the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> ceased to exist for an amount equal to the <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> of all the property held in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> at the time of death.</p>
<p>After the holder's death, the deposit or annuity contract is considered to be a separate contract and is no longer considered as <span class="nowrap"></span>a <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>. All earnings that grow after the holder's death will be taxable to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>The normal rules apply for reporting income or gains accrued after the date of death, depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or annuity contract. For example, interest earned would be reported on a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t5.html">T5, Statement of Investment Income</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general_trust">General rules&nbsp;– Arrangement in trust</h3>
<p>If there is no <a href="#success_holder">successor holder</a>, a <abbr title="Tax-Free Savings Account">TFSA</abbr> that is an arrangement in trust is deemed to continue and it stays a non-taxable trust until the end of the <a href="#exempt_period">exempt period</a>.</p>
<p>All income earned during the exempt period and paid to the beneficiaries, will be included in their income, while earnings that accrued before death remain exempt. In other words, any amount up to the <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> of the deceased holder's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> as of the date of death can be paid to beneficiaries, without them having to report any amount as income. Any amount paid to beneficiaries that represents an increase in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">FMV</abbr> after the date of death is taxable to the beneficiaries and has to be reported by them as income. Such payments will appear in <span class="nowrap">box 134</span>, &quot;Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount&quot; in the &quot;Other information&quot; section of a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A, Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income</a>.</p>
<p>The trust has the exempt period within which to distribute both the taxable and <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> amounts. The trustee will assign the part of each payment that represents non-taxable <abbr title="Fair market value">FMV</abbr> at the date of death with the rest being taxable.</p>
<p>Payments of amounts earned above the FMV made by the trust to a non-resident beneficiary, including a <span class="nowrap">non-resident </span><a href="#survivor">survivor</a>, from a deceased holder's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> during the <a href="#exempt_period">exempt period</a> are reported on an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html"><span class="nowrap">NR4 slip</span>, Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada</a>. These payments are subject to non-resident withholding tax.</p>
<p>If the trust continues to exist beyond the end of the exempt period (for example, not all amounts from the deceased's <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> have been paid to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward. It becomes a taxable inter vivos trust with a tax year beginning January&nbsp;1st of the following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and immediately reacquired its property for its <abbr title="Fair Market Value">FMV</abbr> at that time. For as long as it continues to exist, the trust would itself be taxable on any undistributed income (including, for its first tax year, any undistributed income or gains during the exempt period) and required to annually file a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3RET, T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return</a>. The trust will also be required to prepare a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">T3, Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations</a> in that year or later years for any distributions of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>

        <p>In 2024, Joelle begins the year with a&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;contribution room of $7,000.</p>
<p>Joelle's contributions and withdrawals for 2024 are the following amounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>contribution on April 25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$3,000</li>
<li>contribution on May 16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $4,000</li>

<li>contribution on August 23&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$2,000</li>
<li>withdrawal on September 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $1,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Joelle's first two contributions, in&nbsp;April and May, reduced her&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;contribution room to zero. Since&nbsp;her June withdrawal does not get added back to her contribution room until the following year, her August contribution caused an excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount of $2,000 in that month. Her September withdrawal of&nbsp;$1,500&nbsp;would be considered a&nbsp;<strong>qualifying portion of the withdrawal</strong>&nbsp;in computing her highest excess TFSA amount for the following month, October. An excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of $500&nbsp;stays until the end of the year and she will have to pay a 1% tax for the months of August to December.</p>
<p>Joelle's tax would be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>highest excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount per month for August and September&nbsp;was $2,000. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount is $40 ($2,000 x 1% x 2 months).</li>
<li>highest excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount per month for October to December&nbsp;was $500. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount is $15 ($500 × 1% × 3 months).</li>
</ul>
<p>Joelle's withdrawals from her&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;will be added to her&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;room at the beginning of 2025.</p>

Since Gilles’ TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024 was only&nbsp;$7,000 (the TFSA dollar limit for 2024), his contribution of&nbsp;$9,000 on March&nbsp;3rd resulted in an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,000.</p>
<p>On May&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2024, Gilles withdrew&nbsp;$3,700 from his TFSA. The qualifying portion of this withdrawal was&nbsp;$2,000, since this was the maximum amount that eliminated the excess TFSA amount in his account.</p>
<p>No part of the&nbsp;$1,700 portion of his withdrawal (the full amount of&nbsp;$3,700 less the qualifying portion of&nbsp;$2,000) could have been used in the year to reduce any later excess TFSA amount. In other words, if Gilles had made a new contribution of&nbsp;$1,000 on July&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2024, it would still have resulted in an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$1,000, as of that date, even though Gilles previously withdrew&nbsp;$1,700 more than his excess TFSA amount on May&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2024.</p>

        <p>From the situation above, if Gilles had withdrawn&nbsp;$1,400 on&nbsp;May&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2024 (instead of withdrawing&nbsp;$3,700), the qualifying portion of the withdrawal would have been the full&nbsp;$1,400, since the entire amount would have reduced (but not fully remove) his previously determined excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,000.</p>
<p>In this case, an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$600 would remain in his account as of the&nbsp;May&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2024 withdrawal (the previously determined excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,000 minus the&nbsp;$1,400 qualifying portion of the withdrawal). If, in this scenario, Gilles had made a new contribution of&nbsp;$1,000 on July&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2024, it would result in an excess TFSA amount, as of that date, of&nbsp;$1,600 ($600&nbsp;+&nbsp;$1,000).</p>
<p>If, at any time in a month, you have an excess TFSA amount, you are subject to a tax of&nbsp;1% on your highest excess TFSA amount in that month.</p>

        <p>Jamal is 43 years of age and a Canadian resident. He opened his&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;in 2009 and made the maximum&nbsp;contributions in each year. In 2023, Jamal made the following transactions during the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>contribution on January 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$5,000</li>
<li>contribution on March 10 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $1,500</li>
<li>contribution on June 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $2,700</li>
<li>withdrawal on October 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $800</li>
</ul>
<p>Jamal’s contribution room for 2023 was&nbsp;$6,500. The first contribution that created the excess TFSA amount <span class="nowrap">was the&nbsp;</span>$2,700 contribution on June 3rd. As of that date, his total contributions in 2023 were&nbsp;$9,200 <span class="nowrap">($5,000 +&nbsp;$1,500 +&nbsp;$2,700)</span>. This means that as of June 3rd, he had an excess amount in his TFSA of&nbsp;$2,700 <span class="nowrap">($9,200 of</span> total contributions minus&nbsp;$6,500 of contribution room).</p>
<p>Jamal had to pay a tax on his excess contributions. This tax was 1% of the highest excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount in each month and applies until Jamal either withdraws the entire excess amount or until he becomes entitled to enough unused&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;contribution room to absorb the excess.</p>
<p>In this example, Jamal's tax was $173 for 2023, calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>highest excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount per month for January to May was $0. No tax is payable for those months.</li>
<li>highest excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount per month for June to October was $2,700. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount was $135 ($2,700 × 1% × 5 months).</li>
<li>highest excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount per month for November and December was $1,900. Tax of 1% per month on the excess amount was $38 ($1,900 × 1% × 2 months).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Jamal withdrew $800 in October, the tax was calculated based on the highest excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount in each month. The highest excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount in October was still $2,700.</p>
<p>For the months of November and December, Jamal still had an excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount, but because of the withdrawal he made, his remaining excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount for those last two&nbsp;months was $1,900 (the prior excess amount of $2,700 less the withdrawal of $800).</p>
<p>Therefore, in total for 2023, his tax was $173 ($135 for June to October + $38 for November to December).</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2024, Jamal's&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;contribution room was $5,100 which is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jamal's 2023 and 2024 TFSA&nbsp;limits ($6,500 + $7,000)</li>
<li>less Jamal's contributions in 2023 ($9,200)</li>
<li>plus Jamal's withdrawals from the&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;in 2023 ($800).</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax of 1% per month will continue to apply for each month that the excess <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> amount stays in the&nbsp;TFSA. <span class="nowrap">It will</span> continue to apply until whichever of the following happens first:</p>
<ul>
<li>the entire excess amount is withdrawn for eligible individuals</li>
<li>the entire excess TFSA amount is absorbed by additions to their unused&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;contribution room in the following years</li>
</ul>

        <p>Francine is 39 years of age and a Canadian resident. She opened a TFSA in 2009 and contributed the maximum amount allowable for years 2009 to 2021. At the beginning of January 2022, she contributed&nbsp;$6,000. On June 18, 2022, she received a&nbsp;$7,500 bonus from work and decided to contribute the entire amount on June 25, 2022.</p>
<p>Assuming Francine makes no further contributions or withdrawals, she has an excess TFSA amount of $7,500 in 2022 and $1,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, there will no longer be an excess contribution in her TFSA.&nbsp;The amount of tax payable for each of those years was calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>2022</strong></p>
<p>After making $7,500 contribution on <span class="nowrap">June 25, 2022</span>, Francine had an excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount of $7,500. The <span class="nowrap">highest excess</span> TFSA amount that remained in her account was $7,500 for every month from June to December. <span class="nowrap">At a rate</span> of 1%<span class="nowrap">,</span> this means she had to pay $525 in tax on her excess for the seven months the excess remains&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">($7,500 × 1% × 7 months)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>2023</strong></p>
<p>Francine’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of&nbsp;2022 was negative (-)&nbsp;$7,500. On January 1, 2023, <span class="nowrap">she became</span> entitled to her 2023 TFSA dollar limit of&nbsp;$6,500. Although this helped to reduce the excess TFSA amount from&nbsp;$7,500 to&nbsp;$1,000, it did not completely absorb it. Francine continued to have an excess TFSA <span class="nowrap">amount of&nbsp;$1,000</span> in her account through all of 2023. She had to pay a tax of&nbsp;$120 for the year 2023 <span class="nowrap">($1,000 × 1% × 12 months)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>2024</strong></p>
<p>Francine’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of&nbsp;2023 was negative (–)&nbsp;$1,000. As of January 1, 2024, she was entitled to a new TFSA dollar limit of&nbsp;$7,000. This fully removed the excess TFSA amount in her account. Francine had available contribution room of&nbsp;$ 6,000 and, as long as she does not contribute more than this amount to her TFSA through the remainder of 2024, she would not have to pay any tax on an excess TFSA amount for 2024.</p>
<p>For distributions (withdrawals) occurring after&nbsp;October&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2009, a distribution from a&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;that is a specified distribution cannot reduce or eliminate an individual's excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount.</p>
<p>This tax is similar to the tax of 1% per month on excess <abbr title="Registered retirement savings plan">RRSP</abbr> contributions except that in the case of a&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>, there is no $2,000 &quot;grace&quot; amount. The tax of 1% on an excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount applies from the first $1 of excess contributions.</p>
<p>This tax of 1% per month is based on the highest excess&nbsp;<abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr>&nbsp;amount in your account for each month in which an excess remains. This means that the 1% tax applies for a particular month even if an excess&nbsp;TFSA&nbsp;amount was contributed and withdrawn later during the same month.</p>

        <p>Rosanna is 31 years of age and a Canadian resident. She opened a TFSA on February 6, 2009, and contributed the maximum amount she could contribute for each year from&nbsp;2009 to 2023. In February 2024, she contributed&nbsp;$4,500. Later in the year, she received a windfall of&nbsp;$4,600. She forgot that her contribution limit for 2024 was&nbsp;$7,000 and she decided to contribute the entire&nbsp;$4,600 to her TFSA on October 30, 2024.</p>
<p>After making this contribution, Rosanna had an excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,100 in her account. This is because her total contributions as of October 30th were&nbsp;$9,100&nbsp;($4,500&nbsp;+&nbsp;$4,600 ) which exceeded her available contribution room of&nbsp;$7,000.</p>
<p>Assuming Rosanna made no further TFSA contributions and no withdrawals during the remainder of 2024, she would have to pay a tax of&nbsp;$63 on her excess TFSA amount. This amount was calculated as 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount per month from October to December ($2,100&nbsp;×&nbsp;1%&nbsp;× 3&nbsp;months =&nbsp;$63).</p>
<p>If, after making her&nbsp;$4,600 contribution on October&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2024, Rosanna had realized her mistake and had withdrawn $2,100 on&nbsp;October 31st, she would still have to pay the 1% tax&nbsp;on&nbsp;the excess TFSA amount of&nbsp;$2,100 but only for the month&nbsp;of&nbsp;October. Her tax payable would have been&nbsp;$21&nbsp;($2,100&nbsp;×&nbsp;1% × 1&nbsp;month).</p>

        <p>Gemma is 41&nbsp;years of age and a Canadian resident. At the start of 2022, her available TFSA contribution room was $6,000.</p>
<p>In February&nbsp;2022, she contributed&nbsp;$5,000 into her TFSA and on September&nbsp;7, 2022,&nbsp;she became a non‑resident. On&nbsp;July&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2023, she contributed an additional&nbsp;$2,500 to her TFSA. By the end of 2023, Gemma was still a non‑resident of Canada, and she had not made any withdrawals from her account.</p>
<p>For 2023, Gemma had to pay a tax on the contribution she&nbsp;made while she was a non‑resident and she was also subject to tax on the excess TFSA amount in her account.</p>
<p>Gemma’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of&nbsp;2022 was&nbsp;$1,000 (the TFSA dollar limit of&nbsp;$6,000 less her contribution of&nbsp;$5,000). Gemma was not entitled to the TFSA dollar limit of&nbsp;$6,500 for 2023 since she was a non‑resident throughout that entire year. Gemma’s&nbsp;$2,500 contribution on July&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2023, resulted in an excess TFSA amount in her account at that time of&nbsp;$1,500. This is the amount by which her contribution exceeded her available room.</p>
<p>Gemma’s tax on non‑resident contributions for 2023 was&nbsp;$150 because the full amount of her&nbsp;$2,500 contribution was&nbsp;made while she was a non‑resident and it remained in her account until the end of the year. Since&nbsp;the tax is equal to 1% per month, the tax on her non‑resident contributions was&nbsp;$150 ($2,500 × 1% × the 6&nbsp;months from July to&nbsp;December&nbsp;2023).</p>
<p>Since part of Gemma’s contribution while a non‑resident also created an excess TFSA amount ($1,500, as described above) in her account, she also had to pay the&nbsp;1% tax per month on this amount from July to December&nbsp;2023. Her tax&nbsp;on her excess TFSA amounts was&nbsp;$90&nbsp;($1,500&nbsp;×&nbsp;1%&nbsp;×&nbsp;6&nbsp;months).</p>
<p>For&nbsp;2023, Gemma had to pay a total tax&nbsp;of&nbsp;$240 on her TFSA, made up of&nbsp;$150 in tax on her non‑resident contribution plus&nbsp;$90 in tax on her excess TFSA amount.</p>
<p>Gemma will not accumulate any room in 2023 unless she re‑establishes Canadian residency in that year. She will have to withdraw the entire&nbsp;$2,500 she contributed while she was a non‑resident to avoid an additional tax of 1%&nbsp;per month on the non‑resident contributions as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as on the&nbsp;$1,500 excess TFSA amount.</p>
<p>This tax, calculated on the full amount of the contribution, will apply for each month that any portion of the amount contributed while a non-resident stays in the <abbr title="Tax-free savings account">TFSA</abbr> and will continue to apply until whichever of the following happens first:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contributions are withdrawn in full from the account and designated as a withdrawal of non-resident contributions</li>
<li>the individual becomes a resident of Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>An individual is not subject to the tax of 1% on non-resident contributions for the month in which the full amount of the contribution is withdrawn or, if applicable, the month in which Canadian residency is resumed.</p>

        <p>Hassan is 25 years of age and a resident of Canada. He opened a TFSA in 2021 and contributed the maximum amount he could in 2021 and 2022. His total contributions in 2023 were&nbsp;$1,000, and he made no withdrawals. Hassan became a&nbsp;non‑resident of Canada on February&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2024. He contributed&nbsp;$3,000 to his TFSA on August&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2024. He re‑established his Canadian residency for tax purposes on December 8, 2024.</p>
<p>Hassan’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of&nbsp;2023 was&nbsp;$5,500 (the&nbsp;$6,500 limit less the&nbsp;$1,000 he contributed). Hassan also gained an additional&nbsp;$7,000 TFSA dollar limit for 2024. This is because this amount is not pro‑rated in the year an individual becomes a&nbsp;non‑resident, and he was considered a Canadian resident for part of 2024. This means that as of January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2024, Hassan has a total TFSA contribution room of&nbsp;$12,500 (the&nbsp;$5,500 carried over from the end of 2023 plus the annual limit of&nbsp;$7,000 for 2024).</p>
<p>Even though he has unused TFSA contribution room, a tax is&nbsp;payable if any contributions are made while he was a non‑resident. Since he contributed&nbsp;$3,000 while he&nbsp;was a non‑resident, he would have to pay a tax of 1% of&nbsp;this amount for each month from August to November&nbsp;2024. He&nbsp;is not subject to tax for December as&nbsp;he re‑established Canadian residency in that month.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Hassan had to pay $120 in tax based on his non-resident contribution ($3,000 × 1% × 4 months).</p>

        <h2 id="Cnlltn_of_pnlt_or_intrst">Cancel or waive penalties and interest</h2>
<p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called taxpayer relief provisions, that allows the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties and interest when taxpayers cannot meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ends within 10 calendar years before the year in which a relief request is made.</p>
<p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2024 must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending in 2014 or later.</p>
<p>For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that accrued during the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2024 must relate to interest that accrued in 2014 or later.</p>
<p>Taxpayer relief requests can be made online using the <span class="nowrap">CRA's&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></span>, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>&nbsp;(MyBA), or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>&nbsp;digital services</p>
