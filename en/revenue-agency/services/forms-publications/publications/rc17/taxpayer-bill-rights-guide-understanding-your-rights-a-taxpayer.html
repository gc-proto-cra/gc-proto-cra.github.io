        <h4>Speak to us if you disagree with one of our decisions</h4>
<p><span><span>Disagreements can be caused by a lack of information or by simple miscommunication. Before you&nbsp;send an objection or appeal a CRA decision, contact us to obtain an explanation of your notice. Also, if you have a new or additional information, you can request an adjustment. However, talking to us will not delay the deadline for&nbsp;sending an objection or an appeal.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Interest charges will continue to accumulate during this period.</strong> In circumstances that are specified in legislation, such as when an amount is in jeopardy, the CRA can take collection action even though an objection or an appeal has <span class="nowrap">been sent</span>.</p>
<p>After talking to us, you may not be satisfied with our explanation, or you may think we have misinterpreted the facts or we have not applied the law correctly. If you find yourself in one of these situations, you have a legislated right to object, appeal, or request a <span class="nowrap">second–level</span> review of your concern. Objections, appeals, and reviews may deal with such <span class="nowrap">things as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>income tax assessments and reassessments</li>
<li>Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance assessments and rulings</li>
<li>goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (<span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span>) assessments and reassessments</li>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>To make sure our review&nbsp;processes are impartial</h4>
<p>Officers at the CRA are responsible for carrying out complete, professional, and impartial reviews of disputes. Such disputes can arise as a result of administrative decisions, assessments of income tax, excise tax, GST/HST, Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance rulings and assessments, and assessments under the Air Travellers Security Charge Act and the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006.</p>
<p>The officer responsible for handling your file will not have been involved with the original decision under dispute. This independent review <span class="nowrap">will involve the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>applying acts administered by the CRA and reviewing CRA policies</li>
<li>considering your point of view</li>
<li>when necessary, asking for a technical opinion from CRA experts or from the Department of Justice</li>
</ul>
<p>The officer assigned to your file will conduct a preliminary review of the facts and issues relevant to your situation. As&nbsp;part of this review, you or your authorized representative may be contacted to discuss the issues in dispute and to get more documents and details. You will also be offered copies of material the CRA is relying on&nbsp;to support its position. The officer will then consider the&nbsp;information and make a decision.</p>
<p><span>If you are not satisfied with the decision reached by the officer, you can appeal or seek a judicial review of that decision from the appropriate court or, for certain matters, to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Cancel or waive penalties or interest</h4>
<p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called the taxpayer relief provisions, that gives the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties or interest when taxpayers are unable to meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 calendar years before the year in which a request is made.</p>
<p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or&nbsp;fiscal period ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2022 must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending in 2012 or later.</p>
