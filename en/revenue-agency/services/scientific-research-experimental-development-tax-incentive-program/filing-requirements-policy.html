	<h2>Changes to the SR&amp;ED Filing Requirements Policy</h2>
	<p><strong>Reasons for revision</strong><br/>
This revision accommodates the legislative changes that have been announced and the extension of some scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED) reporting deadlines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/><strong>Revision overview</strong><br/>
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canada Revenue Agency has extended the filing due dates for submitting some 2019 and 2020 income tax returns, which resulted in the extension of certain SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines. Additionally, the minister of national revenue under the Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19), issued an order to extend SR&amp;ED deadlines normally occurring from March 13, 2020, through December 30, 2020, for six months, but no later than December 31, 2020. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/filing-requirements-policy.html#toca">Appendix A</a>.<br/><br/>
The text of this policy has been revised to reflect editorial changes. See <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/filing-requirements-policy.html#tocc1">Appendix C.1 Explanation of changes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to clarify the position of the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) regarding filing requirements when administering the scientific research and experimental development (<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>) legislation under the federal Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Regulations.</p>

        <h3 id="toc11">1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> program provides the following two tax incentives:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures can be claimed as part of the&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#plddct">pool of deductible&nbsp;<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures</a> to reduce income for tax purposes in the current tax year or carried forward to reduce income&nbsp;of&nbsp;future tax years;</li>
<li>a taxpayer can receive <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credits (<abbr title="investment tax credits">ITCs</abbr>)</a> on&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfsrd">qualified&nbsp;<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures</a> in the form of a cash refund, a reduction of tax payable, or both depending on the circumstances. Unused <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr>s may be carried back or carried forward. For more information on <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr>, refer to the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html"><abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> Investment Tax Credit Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make an <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claim for these tax incentives, certain filing requirements must be met. To access the incentives for&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd"><abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr></a>&nbsp;work carried on&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncnd">in Canada</a> in the year, a person must complete certain prescribed forms (see <a href="#toc3">section&nbsp;3.0</a>) (when the claimant of SR&amp;ED expenditures is a partnership, see <a href="#toc65">section&nbsp;6.5</a>) and submit these forms containing the prescribed information (see <a href="#toc4">section&nbsp;4.0</a>) in respect of an expenditure, and the <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr> earned on the expenditure, by the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> reporting deadline (see <a href="#toc61">section&nbsp;6.1</a>). The <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> reporting deadline is 12-months after the filing due date for a return (see <a href="#toc5">section&nbsp;5.0</a>), which is dependent on the type of taxpayer. For example, the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> reporting deadline for corporations is generally 18-months after the tax year end. The <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> filing requirements apply to any original or amended prescribed form for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> (see <a href="#toc7">section&nbsp;7.0</a> and <a href="#toc8">section&nbsp;8.0</a>). Specific forms or schedules must be filed to claim provincial or territorial <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits (see <a href="#toc10">section&nbsp;10.0</a>).</p>

<p>In order to be able to deduct an <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditure in the calculation of net income for tax purposes, a claimant must have identified the expenditure on the prescribed form (see <a href="#toc31">section 3.1</a>) containing the prescribed information (see <a href="#toc41">section 4.1</a>) in respect of the expenditure, on or before the day that is 12 months after the claimant's income tax return filing due date (see <a href="#toc5">section 5.0</a>) for the year in which the expenditure was incurred.</p>
<p>The prescribed form identifying <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures should be filed with an income tax return for the year (when the claimant of <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures is a partnership, see <a href="#toc65">section 6.5</a>).

<p>A partnership cannot claim an <abbr title="income tax credit"><abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr></abbr> since it does not file a tax return.

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Partnership exempt from filing T5013 forms</strong></p>
<p>Two individuals are the only members of a partnership. The partnership's fiscal year end is December 31, 2017. This partnership is exempt from filing a Partnership Information Return (T5013 forms) and chooses not to file one.</p>
<p>Each individual's filing due date to submit a tax return would be June 15, 2018.

<p><strong>Processing an <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claim</strong></p>
<p>In order for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to process a <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claim, a claimant must file with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>:</p>

<p>An <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claim that does not consist of the prescribed forms containing the relevant prescribed information and an income tax return (or information return) cannot be processed in a timely manner. Consequently, the processing of the claim will be delayed until the prescribed forms containing the prescribed information in respect of the expenditures and for the <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr> in respect of those expenditures are provided and the return is filed. However, the expenditures will be denied as <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures and there will be no <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr> earned if the prescribed information with respect to the expenditures or for the <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr> earned on those expenditures is not submitted within the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> reporting deadline.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRA has extended the filing due dates for submitting some 2019 and 2020 income tax returns of corporations and trusts. The June 15, 2020, filing due date to submit a 2019 income tax return for individuals operating a proprietorship was not extended.<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html"></a></p>
<p>The Income Tax Act, under subsection 220(2.2), specifically excludes the use of Ministerial discretion (under subsection 220(2.1)) to waive or extend the filing deadline of forms for the SR&amp;ED Tax Incentive Program (expenditure and investment tax credit).</p>
<p>Eligibility for the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/claim-sred-tax-incentive-what-claim.html">SR&amp;ED tax incentives</a> is dependent on the filing of prescribed forms by a specific deadline. As part of the annual income tax return filing, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) Expenditures Claim</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Form T2SCH31, Investment Tax Credit – Corporations</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form T2038-IND Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a> must be filed with the CRA, no later than 12 months after the taxpayer’s income tax return filing due date.</p>
<p>The passing of Bill C-20, an Act respecting further COVID-19 measures, allows the Minister of National Revenue under the, Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19) (TLOPA), to issue an order to extend the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline. On August 31, 2020, an order was issued by the Minister, allowing for the SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines normally occurring from March 13, 2020, through to December 30, 2020, to be extended for six months, but no later than December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>If the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline happens to fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday recognized by the CRA, the CRA will consider the SR&amp;ED claim filed on time if it is sent on the first business day after the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline. When the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline would be on the last day of the month, the extension is to the <strong>last </strong>day of the sixth month or December 31, 2020, if sooner. When the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline is not the last day of a month, the extension is to the same day of the sixth month or December 31, 2020, if sooner.</p>

Corporations with tax year-ends of January 1 to June 29, 2019, that would normally have SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines of July 1 to December 29, 2020, have all been extended to December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRA also extended the filing due dates for submitting some 2019 and 2020 corporate income tax returns. The extensions to the income tax return filing due dates also resulted in extensions to SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the impact of the COVID-19 measures on SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines for corporations.</p>

        <p>*When the corporation’s tax year ends on the last day of a month, the filing due date is the last day of the sixth month after the end of the tax year. Therefore, neither December 30 nor May 30 is required as the 6 month filing due dates for the tax years that end on June 30 and November 30 are December 31 and May 31, respectively.<br>
**May 31 is a Sunday therefore CRA moved the filing due date with the September 1, 2020, deadline period extension.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
A corporation's tax year end is October 31, 2018. The income tax return filing due date was April 30, 2019. With the extension of the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline as a result of the order under the Time Limits and Other Periods Act (six months extension but not past December 31, 2020), the corporation has until October 31, 2020 instead of April 30, 2020 to file or make changes to the prescribed information in respect of an expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661</a> and to include the ITC amount in respect of the expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Schedule T2SCH31</a>, for the October 31, 2018, income tax return.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>
A corporation's tax year end is January 31, 2019. The income tax return filing due date was July 31, 2019. With the extension of the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline as a result of the order under the Time Limits and Other Periods Act (six months extension but not past December 31, 2020), the corporation has until December 31, 2020 instead of <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">July 31</span>, 2020 to file or make changes to the prescribed information in respect of an expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661</a> and to include the ITC amount in respect of the expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Schedule T2SCH31</a>, for the January 31, 2019, income tax return.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong><br>
A corporation’s tax year end is September 30, 2019. The income tax return filing due date would be March 31, 2020, but because of the COVID measures, the income tax return filing due dates for corporations that would otherwise have a filing deadline after March 18 and before May 31, 2020 have been extended to June 1, 2020. Consequently, the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline is extended to June 1, 2021, which is 12 months after the revised filing due date.</p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong><br>
A corporation’s tax year end is November 30, 2019. The income tax return filing due date would be May 31, 2020, but because of the COVID measures, the income tax return filing due dates for corporations that would otherwise have a filing deadline on May 31, or in June, July, or August 2020 have been extended to September 1, 2020. Consequently, the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline is extended to September 1, 2021, which is 12 months after the revised filing due date.</p>

        <p>An individual operating a sole proprietorship has a filing due date to submit a tax return that is June 15, after their tax year-end. A proprietorship’s tax year-end is always December 31. The SR&amp;ED reporting deadline for individuals operating a proprietorship is 12-months after the tax return filing due date. A sole proprietorship with a December 31, 2018, tax year-end would normally have an SR&amp;ED reporting deadline of June 15, 2020, but the ministerial order has extended this date to December 15, 2020. The June 15, 2020, filing due date to submit a 2019 individual operating a proprietorship income tax return was not extended, and the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline remains June 15, 2021.

With the extension of the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline as a result of the order under the Time Limits and Other Periods Act (six months extension but not past December 31, 2020), the trust will now have until September 13, 2020 instead of March 13, 2020 to file or make changes to the prescribed information in respect of an expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661</a> and to include the ITC amount in respect of the expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">T2038-IND Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a>, for the December 31, 2018, T3 Trust income tax and information return.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trust’s tax year end is January 31, 2020. The income tax return filing due date would be April 30, 2020 but because of the COVID measures, the income tax return filing due dates for trusts that would otherwise have a filing deadline after March 30 and before May 31, 2020 have been extended to June 1, 2020. Consequently, the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline for this trust is extended to June 1, 2021, to file or make changes to the prescribed information in respect of an expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661</a> and to include the ITC amount in respect of the expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">T2038-IND Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a>, for the January 31, 2020, T3 Trust income tax and information return.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong><br>
A trust’s tax year end is March 31, 2020. The income tax return filing due date would be June 29, 2020, but because of the COVID measures, the income tax return filing due dates for trusts that would otherwise have a filing deadline on May 31, or in June, July, or August 2020, have been extended to September 1, 2020. Consequently, the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline for this trust is extended to September 1, 2021, to file or make changes to the prescribed information in respect of an expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html">Form T661</a> and to include the ITC amount in respect of the expenditure on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">T2038-IND Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a>, for the March 31, 2020, T3 Trust income tax and information return.</p>
