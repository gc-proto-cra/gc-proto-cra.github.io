<h2 id="h1">Use your SR&amp;ED ITC to reduce income tax payable</h2>
<p>You may earn an  investment tax credit (ITC) on your qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures for the  year, which may reduce your income tax payable. If you have excess  ITCs in the year and are eligible, you may also get a refund.</p>
<h3>Who can get an ITC</h3>
<p> The following entities may earn an ITC on their qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Corporations</li>
  <li>Individuals</li>
  <li>Trusts</li>
  <li>Partners in a partnership </li>
</ul>
             
<details>             
<summary>Partnerships cannot claim an ITC</summary>
<p> Since a partnership is not a taxpayer, it cannot claim an  ITC. In general, the ITC is calculated at the partnership level and then allocated to eligible partners in the partnership (individuals, corporations, or  trusts). </p>
<p>If you are submitting a partnership claim for SR&amp;ED, review the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/claims-partnerships-policy.html">SR&amp;ED Claims for Partnerships Policy</a>.</p>
</details>
             
<h3>Complete the SR&amp;ED ITC form</h3>
<p>Claimants must complete the investment tax credit form for either corporations or individuals.</p>

<h4>For corporations</h4>
<p>Corporations calculate their SR&amp;ED ITC using:</p/>

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="far fa-file-pdf fa-lg text-muted fa-li"></span> <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch31.html">Form T2SCH31, Investment Tax Credit - Corporations</a></li>
</ul>    

<h4>For individuals</h4>
<p>Individuals and trusts calculate their SR&amp;ED ITC using:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="far fa-file-pdf fa-lg text-muted fa-li"></span> <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2038-ind.html">Form T2038-IND, Investment Tax Credit (Individuals)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h2">Understand ITC rates</h2>
<h3>Basic rate</h3>
<p>The basic ITC rate is <strong>15% on qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures</strong> for corporations, individuals, trusts, and partners in a partnership. </p>
<h3>Enhanced rate</h3>
<p>Most Canadian  controlled private corporations (CCPCs), whether stand-alone or associated, may earn an ITC on qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures at the enhanced <strong>rate of 35%, up to a maximum threshold of $3 million</strong>. This is called the expenditure limit.</p>
<p>Any qualified  expenditures <strong>beyond the expenditure limit  earn an ITC at the basic rate of 15%</strong>. </p>
<p>If a CCPC is a  qualifying corporation, 40% of the ITC earned at 15% can be refunded.</p>

<details>             
<summary>What is a qualifying corporation</summary>
<p>A qualifying corporation is a CCPC whose taxable income (or total taxable income if associated with another corporation) in the  previous year was not more than their qualifying income limit for the current  year.</p>
<p>For detailed information on qualifying corporations and their income limit, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s4_2">Section 4.2, SR&amp;ED ITC Policy</a>.</p>
</details>    
<h2 id="h3">Determine your expenditure limit</h2>
<p>The expenditure limit for most CCPCs is $3 million. However, some large CCPCs may have a reduced expenditure limit. </p>
<details>
  <summary>What is the reduced expenditure limit</summary>
  <p>The limit starts  to decrease when a CCPC&rsquo;s taxable capital employed in Canada for the previous tax year reaches $10 million. The limit becomes zero  starting at $50 million.</p>
<p>Other factors can also reduce the ITC expenditure  limit for CCPCs, including short tax years and having multiple tax years within  one calendar year.</p>
</details>		 

		 
<p>For detailed information on determining expenditure limits, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_1">Section 3.1, SR&amp;ED ITC Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Expenditure limit for associated corporations</h3>
<p>If your corporation is associated with one or more&nbsp;CCPCs, you must allocate the expenditure limit  among the associated&nbsp;CCPCs.</p>
<p>Associated corporations must use Schedule 49 to allocate the expenditure limit:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="far fa-file-pdf fa-lg text-muted fa-li"></span> <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch49.html">Schedule&nbsp;49, Agreement Among Associated CCPCs to  Allocate the Expenditure Limit</a>.</li>
</ul>
    
		 <details>
<summary>What is an associated corporation</summary>
<h3>Associated corporations</h3>
 <p>The CRA considers 2 or more  corporations to be associated for SR&amp;ED if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>they are  associated with the same third corporation </li>
  <li>the main reason  for the separate existence is to reduce income tax payable or increase the  amount of refundable ITCs  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Not associated corporations</h3>			 
			 <p>For SR&amp;ED, the CRA does not consider a corporation associated if the only reason they might be associated is because 2 or more investors have shares in each  corporation. The corporations must also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not be associated for any other reason</li>
  <li>have at least  one shareholder of one corporation who is not a shareholder of the other corporation and it&rsquo;s not for the purpose of satisfying these provisions</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about determining if a corporation is associated, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_2">Section 3.2, SR&amp;ED ITC Policy</a>.</p>
</details>    

<h2 id="h4">Carry back or carry forward an ITC</h2>
<p>Claimants who have an unused  ITC beyond the amount needed to reduce income tax payable to zero may carry it back 3 years or carry it forward 20 years. This lets you use the credit to reduce your tax  payable for other years.</p>
<p>A refunded ITC  will reduce the credit available for carry back or forward.</p>
<p>To learn more about carrying back ITCs, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/investment-tax-credit-policy.html#s3_3_2">Section 2.3.2, SR&amp;ED ITC Policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h5">Refundable ITC</h2>
<p>Claimants may be able to have some or all of their SR&amp;ED ITC refunded. If an ITC isn&rsquo;t applied in the year to reduce income tax payable and is not carried back, it may be refunded.</p>
<p>Most CCPCs can earn a refundable ITC at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified expenditures up to their expenditure limit for the tax year. Individuals may get a partial refund of their ITC earned at 15%. Generally an  ITC can only be refunded in the year that the qualified expenditure occurred.</p>
<p>The refund rate varies depending on if the claimant is a corporation, an individual, a trust, or a partner in a partnership.</p>
