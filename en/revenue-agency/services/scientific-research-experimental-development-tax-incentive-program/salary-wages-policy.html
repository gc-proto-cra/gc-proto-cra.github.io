	<h2>Changes to the SR&amp;ED Salary or Wages Policy</h2>
	<div> 
 <p><strong>Reasons for revision</strong></p> 
 <p>This revision accommodates the legislative changes that have been announced.</p> 
 <p><strong>Revision overview</strong></p> 
 <p>Legislation was enacted to confirm that the value of an option granted and the increase between the option price and the exercised share price (relating to stock option benefits) are not allowable scientific research and experimental development (<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>) expenditures.</p> 
 <p>The text of this document has been revised to reflect these changes, see <a href="#ppx2_1">Appendix B.1 Explanation of changes</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="s2_0">2.0 Overview</h2>
 <p>The term "salary or wages" is defined in the <em>Income Tax Act</em>&nbsp;(see <a href="#s2_1">section 2.1</a>)&nbsp;and means income from an office or employment. Salary or wages generally includes any expenditure made in respect of a benefit that would be taxable to the employee under section 6 of the&nbsp;Act (see&nbsp;<a href="#s3_0">section 3.0</a>) as well as vacation pay, statutory holiday pay, sick leave pay, pay in lieu of termination notice, bonuses (see <a href="#s4_0">section 4.0</a>), tips and gratuities, honorariums, director's fees, management fees and commissions. These amounts must be paid to or incurred for the employees in the year (see <a href="#s2_2">section 2.2</a>).</p>  <p>Salary or wages do not include amounts in respect of the employer's shares of the related benefits (see <a href="#s5_1">section 5.1</a>), amounts for extended vacation or sick leave (see <a href="#s5_2">section 5.2</a>), stock options benefits (see <a href="#s5_3">section 5.3</a>) and retiring allowances (see <a href="#s5_4">section 5.4</a>). There is also a general rule that applies to exclude unpaid salary or wages (see <a href="#s11_0">section 11.0</a>).</p>  <p>The general rules described in the sections referred to above also apply for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr> purposes. However, there are specific rules that apply in order for salary or wages to be an allowable <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditure. These rules are discussed in <a href="#s7_0">section 7.0</a>&nbsp;for claimants using the&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#pmthd">proxy method</a> and in <a href="#s8_0">section 8.0</a>&nbsp;for claimants using the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tmthd">traditional method</a>.</p>  <p>Other specific rules apply to salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> purposes. There are rules for: specified employees (see <a href="#s6_0">section 6.0</a>), administrative salary or wages under the traditional method (see <a href="#s9_0">section 9.0</a>) and for salary or wages of employees performing <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr> outside Canada (see <a href="#s10_0">section 10.0</a>).</p>

 <p>Taxable benefits are benefits or allowances an employer provides to its employees that are taxable under the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. For example: automobile benefits; housing, board, and meals; gifts and awards; interest-free or low-interest loans; group term life insurance policies; or tuition fees.</p>  <p>As stated in the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4088.html">T4088, Guide to Form T661 Scientific Research and Experimental Development (<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr>) Expenditures Claim</a>, <em>s</em>alary or wages could relate to gross wages reported on a <abbr title="Statement of Earnings and Employer Deductions ">T4</abbr> slip for the calendar year if the tax year ends at the calendar year-end.</p>  <p>However, when using the <abbr title="Statement of Earnings and Employer Deductions ">T4</abbr> slips as a basis for determining the allowable salary or wages, certain adjustments may be required to be made as discussed in sections 3.1 to 3.3 below.</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative reference </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Section 6 Taxable benefits</p>

        <h3 id="s3_1">3.1 Expenditure incurred vs. value of taxable benefits</h3>
 <p>Where an employee receives a <strong>non-cash benefit</strong>, the employer must determine <strong>the value of the benefit</strong> and include that value in the employee's income. A list of all non-cash benefits is provided in Guide <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4130.html">T4130, Employer's Guide&nbsp;– Taxable Benefits and Allowances</a>. For the employer, however, the value of a benefit is <strong>not an expenditure incurred</strong> and, therefore, is not an allowable <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditure. In certain cases, the actual costs incurred by the company may have no relation to the value of the benefits otherwise determined. In determining the allowable amount of a taxable benefit, only the actual costs incurred in respect of the taxable benefits should be included in the allowable salary or wages.</p>  <p>This is consistent with the existing practice applicable to the automobile standby charge (see <a href="#s3_1_1">section 3.1.1</a>). The value of a benefit to the claimant will be allowed as an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development ">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditure if all the following conditions are met:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>it represents a reasonable estimate of the actual cost incurred (the onus is on the claimant to demonstrate the reasonableness);</li> 
 <li>the amount of the benefit claimed does not include any <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> / <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> or <abbr title="Provincial Sales Tax">PST</abbr> (unless no input tax credit refund was claimed) (see <a href="#s3_2">section 3.2</a>); and</li> 
 <li>the actual costs, including capital cost allowance (<abbr title="Capital Cost Allowance ">CCA</abbr>), to which the value of the benefits relates are not claimed as business expenses under section 9 of the Act.</li>

 <p>"Bonus" is an amount in addition to the employee's normal remuneration (additional remuneration).</p>  <p><strong>Unenforceable bonus</strong> </p>  <p>An unenforceable "bonus" refers to a payment that is not earned and is a gift or gratuity. The amount would be considered to be a bonus if it was not paid pursuant to the employee's terms of employment and the employer was under no obligation to make the payment. For this purpose, the extent to which a bonus payment is based on an employee's performance is immaterial.</p>  <p><strong>Enforceable bonus</strong> </p>  <p>An enforceable "bonus" refers to an amount paid (premium) to an employee in recognition of achieving certain performance objectives pursuant to the employee's terms of employment (or specific agreement). In that case, the employer was under no obligation to pay the bonus until the employee met the specific performance objectives. The liability will be recognized as a bonus only in the year the legal obligation arises.</p>  <p>The number of times in the year that a bonus is paid does not, in itself, affect the meaning of the term "bonus".</p>  <p>Where an employee performs duties that are considered to be directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> under the proxy method (see <a href="#s7_0">section 7.0</a>) or are considered to be directly undertaking, supervising or supporting the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> under the traditional method (see&nbsp;<a href="#s8_0">section 8.0</a>) and the only remuneration in the year in respect of performing those duties was bonuses or remuneration based on profits, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will consider an amount thereof that is commensurate with the performance of those duties to be salary or wages directly attributable to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> or directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.

However, any time spent by a manager or supervisor performing non-technological management activities or decision-making functions that do not directly influence the course of the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, even if it relates to the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, is not considered to be time the manager or supervisor is directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. In most cases, work performed beyond the first-line level of supervision does not qualify as directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. Where time is claimed for employees beyond the first-line level of supervision, the claimant will be asked to provide details of the duties the employees performed during the time they were directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. The claimant will also have to demonstrate how these duties are "directly engaged," as described above.</p>  <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does not consider clerical and administrative staff providing a service to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> employees to be directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. This includes clerks, secretaries, and receptionists engaged in accounting, payroll, finance, legal support, purchasing, sales, human resources, shipping, inventory control, maintenance, word processing, and other such activities.

 <li>carrying out experiments, tests, and analyzes;</li> 
 <li>collecting data commensurate with the needs and directly in support of the experimentation and analyses; and</li> 
 <li>directing the course of the ongoing <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> activities being claimed in the year;</li>

 <p>"Directly engaged" work could include hands-on work performed by both specialized and non‑specialized employees. Whether the work of a non-specialized employee can be considered work "directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>" is a question of fact. This would be the case only if the following conditions are met:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>The work performed by the non-specialized employee must be <strong>directly</strong> in support and be an integral part of the basic or applied research or experimental development work.</li> 
 <li>The non-specialized employee's work must be supervised by staff with scientific or technological qualifications.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The term "direct" means proceeding from one point to another without deviation or interruption; straight; "directly" would mean in a direct manner, without an intervening step or intermediary. This means that only the time spent by a non-specialized employee who is involved in an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project, in a direct manner and without an intervening step or intermediary, could qualify as directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work.</p>  <p>Further, an activity is considered to be directly in support of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> when it is reasonable to believe that the activity is required to carry out the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. That is, it has been shown to be an integral part of the systematic investigation of a problem, and is required in the search for a theoretical or practical solution.</p>  <p>Tasks performed by non-specialized employees are generally not considered to be "directly engaged" in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. For example, any work related to equipment maintenance or repairs, materials-handling, and clerical and administrative support activities does not qualify under the proxy method.</p>  <p>However, examples of tasks performed by a non-specialized employee who could qualify as directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> include:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>operating a machine for the purposes of an experiment that requires the use of this machine;</li> 
 <li>feeding raw materials into a machine for the purposes of an experiment;</li> 
 <li>performing work such as welding, machining, mechanics, electrical work and plumbing where that work is required and is an integral part of an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project (for example, construction and testing of a prototype); and</li>

 <p>The directly engaged salary or wages or portion thereof is calculated on the time spent directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> relative to the total time worked. For example, if a salaried employee earning $100,000 per year spends all of their 1,800 regular hours directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and works an additional 600 hours of unpaid overtime performing general administrative duties, the directly engaged salary or wages are $75,000 (1,800 / 2,400 x $100,000).</p>

 <p>The fact that an amount is included in the calculation of salary or wages of an employee directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> does not necessarily mean that it represents salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> purposes. Where the proxy method is used, the legislation clearly indicates that only that portion of salary or wages that is <strong>reasonably related to work that is directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> </strong> can be allowed as an expenditure for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> purposes.</p>  <p>The term "relate" means to show a logical or causal connection between; to have relationship or connection (between two things). Accordingly, there must be a reasonable connection between the amount of salary or wages and the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. It should be noted that, in the case of employees who spend <abbr title="All or Substantially All">ASA</abbr> of their time to the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, all of their time is considered to be related to the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.</p>  <p>In order to determine if there is a reasonable link between an amount of salary or wages and the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work being performed, the underlying reasons for paying the salary or wages would have to be determined and demonstrate how it is related to the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.</p>  <p>Bonus or remuneration based on profits paid or payable to an employee who is not a specified employee of a corporation has the capacity to be related to the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, and therefore could be an expenditure on or in respect of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. For example, where a corporation is taking advantage of marginal tax rates by reducing the corporation's taxable income to or below the small business deduction limit through the payment of bonuses or remuneration based on profits from income derived from normal business operations, the bonus or remuneration based on profit could be considered to have a reasonable link to the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.</p>  <p>There would be no reasonable link between the expenditure and the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> where, for example, an employee (where the <abbr title="All or Substantially All">ASA</abbr> rules do not apply, see&nbsp;<a href="#s7_3_4">section 7.3.4</a>&nbsp;below) receives:</p>  <ul>

 <p>The portion of salary or wages for hands-on work performed by administrative staff is an expenditure directly attributable to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and could qualify as salary or wages of an employee who directly undertakes, supervises or supports the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. However, work performed by administrative staff with no technological background generally does not qualify as hands-on work. In this case, an analysis of the duties performed is required to determine the direct linkage to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work. If the expenditure for administrative salary or wages is&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rltd">directly related</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrmntl">incremental</a> to the prosecution of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> it can be claimed as <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#vrhd">overhead and other expenditures</a>.</p>  <p>There must be a direct linkage of expenditures for administrative salary or wages to specific <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work, staff or machinery / equipment. To make this determination in respect of a particular employee, it is necessary to examine the duties performed by the employee.</p>  <p>For example, where a vice president (<abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr>) of a company is required to hire a Personnel Manager who, in turn, is required to hire <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> staff, there would be no immediate contact between the <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> or <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> staff. In this situation, no portion of the <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr>'s time could be said to meet the "directly related" test, although there may be an indirect relationship. On the other hand, any time spent by the Personnel Manager in hiring <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> staff could be considered to meet the "directly related" test.</p>  <p>Expenditures for tasks that are attributable entirely to non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work would not qualify.

The lower of <strong>amount A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> can be claimed as the permissible salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> carried on outside Canada.</p>  <p><strong>Amount A – Total of salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on outside Canada</strong> </p>  <p>The salary or wages that can be claimed for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on outside Canada must meet the following criteria:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the costs were incurred after February 25, 2008;</li> 
 <li>the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work was directly undertaken by an employee of the claimant and not performed by a contractor;</li> 
 <li>the employee who performed the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work was a resident of Canada at the time the expense was incurred;</li> 
 <li>the work was <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rbsnss">related to a business</a>&nbsp;of the claimant;</li> 
 <li>the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on by the employee outside Canada was an integral part and solely in support of the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on in Canada (see <a href="#s10_2_1">section 10.2.1</a>); and</li> 
 <li>the salary or wages paid were not subject to income or profits tax from another country (see <a href="#s10_2_2">section 10.2.2</a>).</li> 
</ul>  <p><strong>Amount B – 10% of the total of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> carried on in Canada</strong> </p>  <p>This limit is calculated as 10% of the total salary or wages claimed for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> carried on in Canada (see <a href="#s10_2_3">section 10.2.3</a>). Note: Although the <em>Income Tax Act</em> refers to an expense incurred in the year for salary or wages <strong>paid</strong> to an employee in respect of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, it is the practice of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to use the amount on line 306 of Form T661 (<strong>expenditure incurred</strong>) for the purposes of determining the 10% limit.</p>  <p>For the tax year that includes February 26, 2008, the 10% limit is prorated based on the number of days after February 25, 2008, that are in that tax year over the total number of days that are in that tax year.</p>  <p>The formula is:</p>  <p>(Number of days in the tax year after February 25, 2008) / (Total number of days in the tax year)</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative reference </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Subsection 37(1.5) Salary or wages outside Canada – Limit determined</p>

 <p>Salary or wages paid to an employee for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on outside Canada can be included as permissible salary or wages only if the claimant reasonably believes that the salary or wages is not subject to an income or profits tax imposed, because of the employee's presence or activity in a country other than Canada, by the government of that particular country.</p>  <p>This rule takes into account only those taxes that are applied because of an employee's presence or activities in a foreign country—and not, for example, a tax that applies to a country's citizens regardless of where they live or work.</p>  <p>To determine whether the salary or wages paid to an employee for work performed outside Canada is subject to an income or profits tax imposed by a foreign government, the claimant should consider the tax treaty between Canada and the foreign country in which the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work in support of the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> in Canada is performed.</p>  <p>Usually salary or wages paid to an employee for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on outside Canada can be included as permissible salary or wages if the employee sojourns only a short period of time in the foreign country.

If this condition is not satisfied—for example, if the claimant knows or has reason to believe that the amount is being taxed in the foreign country where its employees are carrying out the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>—salary or wages paid to the employee would not be included in the amount of the permissible salary or wages (see <a href="#s10_1">section 10.1</a>).</p>

 <p>The calculation of permissible salary or wages for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work carried on outside Canada (see <a href="#s10_1">section 10.1</a>) is determined with respect to the total amount of salary or wages for the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> inside Canada.

        <h3 id="s11_2">11.2 Evidence of payment</h3>
 <p>Whether accrued and unpaid remuneration is actually paid within the 180-day period involves a finding of fact that can only be established after examining all the evidence that would support such a conclusion.</p>  <p>The best evidence of payment is that the related payroll withholdings were remitted on time. Source deductions must generally be remitted within 15 days after the month in which the amount was withheld. However, this is not the only acceptable evidence of such payment. Other evidence that would corroborate the payment of the wages would include:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the issuance of a <abbr title="Statement of Earnings and Employer Deductions">T4</abbr> slip to the employee;</li> 
 <li>the reporting of the income by the employee;</li> 
 <li>the actual payment of the amount (by cheque, cash, or journal entry crediting the employee's account with the payer);</li> 
 <li>the directors' resolutions; and</li> 
 <li>other audit evidence which would include the overall condition of the employer's books and records, the historical practice with respect to accruing salary or wages, and the credibility of the payer and employee.</li> 
</ul>  <p>An ordinary promissory note is generally regarded as a promise to pay a debt at a later date, and not as payment of the debt on the date on which the note was issued.

 <p>No deduction is allowed for an amount as, or on account of, a reserve, a sinking fund, or a contingent liability unless it is expressly permitted by the Act.

 <p>The criteria used by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to determine whether an individual is an employee or self-employed have been established by the courts. The question to be determined is whether the contract between the parties is a <strong>contract of service</strong>, which is evidence of an employer / employee relationship, or a <strong>contract for services</strong>, which indicates a client and independent contractor relationship.</p>  <p>Generally, a <strong>contract of service</strong> exists if the person for whom the services are performed has the right to control the amount, the nature and the management of the work to be done, as well as the manner of completing the work. A <strong>contract for services</strong> exists when a person is engaged to achieve a defined objective and is given all the freedom required to attain the desired result.</p>  <p>The contract, which sets out the rights and obligations of both parties, provides important information in determining the type of relationship that exists. However, even more important than the contract is the actual circumstances surrounding the performance of services and whether such findings of facts agree with what is stated in the contract. Thus, the determination of whether there is an employer / employee relationship requires a review of the facts of each case. There is no single conclusive test that can be universally applied to determine whether a person is an employee or is self-employed.</p>  <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> makes every effort to ensure that taxpayers are fully aware of its administrative practices and interpretations. In this regard, the criteria the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> uses to determine whether an individual is an employee of a particular taxpayer or is self-employed have been published in Guide <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4110.html">RC4110, Employee or Self-Employed?</a>, which is available on the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Web site.

Where formal systems have not been implemented, claimants can determine <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> salary or wages using appropriate labour allocation methodologies. This section is intended to provide guidance on the elements of such methodologies and to provide an illustration of a sample application.</p>  <p>This section may be used by claimants for preparing the labour expenditure portion of their <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claims. This section does not address technical documentation for <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work.</p>  <p>The allocation methods outlined here are for illustrative purposes only. Other approaches may be acceptable, as long as they are reasonable within the context of a claimant's research and development (<abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr>) environment, are documented, and are effectively and consistently applied. The suggested approaches can be used with either the&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#pmthd">proxy method</a> or the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tmthd">traditional method</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="s13_1">13.1 Cost allocation methods</h3>
 <p>An <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> cost allocation method is a systematic approach to determining which expenditures, or portion of expenditures, relate to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work. A claimant must be able to show that the cost allocation method used is based on a systematic approach, and provide a reasonable level of accuracy in calculating the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures. Documentation should be kept to identify the key elements of the cost allocation method, including the controls that were used in preparing the claim.</p>  <p>The level of detail and sophistication of books and records will depend on many factors, such as the size of the claimant's organization, the claimant's knowledge of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> policies and practices, and the size of the claim. A small business may have less sophisticated financial control systems than a large company, due to the nature of its business or because of cost constraints. A first-time claimant may have an informal system of calculating <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> labour expenditures, while an experienced claimant may have a more sophisticated system. Where a large organization may rely on a combination of the methods discussed in this chapter, some small businesses may have to rely on informal, naturally generated information to support their allocation of labour costs to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> projects. In all cases, documentation of the labour effort and the related financial information is required to support the reasonableness of the expenditures included in a claim.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="s13_2">13.2 Research and development environment</h3>
 <p>All cost allocation methods use information and documentation that comes from the claimants' information systems. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes that the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> environment will influence the way information is gathered and summarized. The nature and sources of available information will be a key consideration in developing an appropriate labour allocation method.</p>  <p>For illustrative purposes, the following four <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> environments are used to show appropriate labour allocation methods. The four environments discussed in detail in <a href="#s13_5">section 13.5</a>&nbsp;are as follows:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>distinct well-defined <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> projects;</li> 
 <li>dedicated <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> environments;</li> 
 <li>early stage or start-up business;</li> 
 <li>shop floor <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr>.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The methods used to allocate labour expenditures to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> in these four <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> environments can be applied to other real-life <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> environments.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="s13_3">13.3 Support for labour allocation</h3>
 <p>The labour allocation must be supported by evidence that:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the allocation method is appropriate in the company's environment;</li> 
 <li>the allocation method is consistent with the <em>Income Tax Act</em> and the administrative practices of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>; and</li> 
 <li>the allocation system is functional throughout the year.</li> 
</ul>  <p>There are generally three levels at which information can be summarized:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>high</li> 
 <li>medium</li> 
 <li>low</li> 
</ul>  <p>Each level offers a different view of the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project. All the levels may provide a reasonable allocation of labour expenditures to an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project provided they are part of an information system that includes controls that can be tested to evaluate the materiality and accuracy of the results. In some cases, it will be necessary for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to review information at more than one level to properly evaluate whether the allocation method is reasonable or not.</p>

        <h4 id="s13_3_1">13.3.1 High-level information (corporate or strategic concept level)</h4>
 <p>The documentation of a business’s overall corporate and strategic objectives is referred to as high-level information. High-level information is generated by the conceptual high-level management processes and systems that businesses (especially large businesses) use for project management and cost control. For example, the strategic planning process, cost allocation and cost control systems, and project planning and project evaluation processes may all produce information that is relevant and useful in shaping and proving <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claims. High-level information may provide context for the allocation method and may, in some circumstances, contain enough information to support a claim and no further review is needed. However, medium or low level information should be available to support high-level information.</p>

        <h4 id="s13_3_2"> <strong>13.3.2 Medium-level information</strong> (project level)</h4>
 <p>Information related to specific work efforts within a project or subproject is referred to as medium-level information. This includes management processes associated with specific work efforts or projects undertaken by the business.</p>  <p>This information supports the information generated by the high-level systems. Medium-level information is generated at the project level and generally relates to a business's documentation of specific work efforts. Specific project plans that break projects into components or subprojects would be an example of medium-level information. These project plans could be revised as a result of the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> process.</p>  <p>In some businesses, these work efforts are documented using financial reports (budget to actual), Gantt charts, time lines, resource allocation or utilization summaries, specific project cost control systems, and supervisor summaries for project team members. There should be a clear link between the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project objectives and the work undertaken by the members of the project team. Documents should identify all employees involved in an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project and should give enough information to identify <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work that is included in the claim. A small sample of medium-level information should show the relevance of the high-level information and support the allocation methods that the claimant has used.</p>

 <p>Information related to individual tasks is referred to as low-level information. In some cases, information may be summarized at the lower level tasks undertaken to complete major work. Tasks can be documented with such things as resource allocation or utilization summaries, time sheets, and personal logs. An effective system of documenting tasks records hours worked on a project-by-project basis. There should be a clear link between the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project objectives and the tasks undertaken by the members of the team.</p>

 <p>The following is a list of potential sources of supporting information that could be used by claimants to support an allocation of labour expenditures to an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project. The objective is to provide key facts including:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the names of the employees performing the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work;</li> 
 <li>confirmation of employment (hire and termination dates);</li> 
 <li>verification that the individual is an employee and not a contractor;</li> 
 <li>identification of specified employee.</li> 
</ul>  <p>In addition, appropriate allocation methodologies can be used to determine the number of hours an employee spent working in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.

        <h4 id="s13_5_1">13.5.1 Distinct well-defined <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> projects</h4>
 <p>This environment is found in situations where the claimant's organization assigns personnel and resources to specific <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> projects. Projects have a defined start date, targeted finish date, and are based on well-defined technological objectives. Where the core project is <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and support work is necessary to resolve the technological challenges, the work effort can be allocated completely to the project. Controls to identify and segregate non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work, such as negative time reporting, provides an indication that the labour allocation is reasonable. Supporting information in this setting may include a development plan that can be used to verify job functions. Where labour resources are used in many projects and in both <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, labour allocations can be made based on such things as:</p>  <ul>

A dedicated research department may be found in any industry, but is more likely to be found in a large multidisciplinary business. It should be noted that a dedicated <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> department might be involved in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work.</p>  <p>Personnel in other areas of the company may also do <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work.

The claimant should also be able to distinguish allowable <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> labour expenditures from the total expenditures of the dedicated research department. Additionally, the claimant should be able to provide documentation with appropriate controls supporting the allocation of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> labour expenditures.

 <p>The following example refers to a small start-up operation, which has developed simple allocation approaches to determine its <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> labour costs. The approaches used in this example are not the only acceptable methods for allocating labour expenditures to an <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project. The methods a company uses to allocate labour expenditures to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work must be tailored to the way it collects and manages financial information. Other methods may be more appropriate in other industry sectors, but the concepts described in this example will be similar.</p>  <p>Aco is a venture-backed start-up company developing a Web-based supply chain management software program that is fully customizable by the customer. The company is developing a new architecture that will serve as the base for a family of products. The development of the initial architecture meets all the requirements to be considered <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.</p>  <p>During the first two months after incorporation, the four founders worked together on the architecture from the home of one of the founders. During this period, each of the developers worked on source code that was annotated and accompanied by a complete revision history. Although a great deal of progress was made, in the third month it was apparent that the seed funding would not take the company far enough. Over the next two months, one of the founders focused on approaching investors to raise more financing instead of working on the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt">experimental development</a>.</p>  <p>By the end of the fifth month, the company had raised $10 million dollars and they were ready to start ramping-up the company. Over the next month, 30 employees were to be hired. The first was a system architect who became responsible for the overall development of the architecture.</p>  <p>Three of the founders stayed heavily involved in the experimental development. The fourth founder continued to develop the business and participated only in the technical strategy design meetings for the ongoing experimental development.</p>  <p>Of the 30 employees added, 3 worked in finance and administration, 5 in sales and marketing, 3 in customer care, 1 in developing technical and user documentation, 4 in quality control, 10 in the research group, and 4 in product engineering.</p>  <p>The system architect knew about the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> Program. During the one-month ramping period, the architect began to write periodic summaries that were to be produced monthly. The summaries allocated the work as <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> undertaken for the given period. The report identified both the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> effort and the non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work during the period in question.</p>  <p>By the sixth month, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr>&nbsp;group found it necessary to use project scheduling and resource allocation tools to manage the experimental development process. These tools permitted the team to identify the resources associated with the specific work. Also in the sixth month, the finance group implemented a time-sheet system. The system was intended to address the overall needs of the company. The time sheet data would enable the finance group to track total hours worked along with employee vacation, holiday and sick leave. The data would provide the information necessary to allocate expenditures to cost centres including experimental development (in other words, the system would be used to allocate researchers' time to projects). In addition, the system would provide the data necessary to bill customers for consulting services after the product was released.</p>  <p>By the eighth month, the company had signed contracts with a number of customers and the customer care group and product-engineering group were busy installing and improving an early release of the software. The company was not large enough to do a complete evaluation in-house. The company needed to install the software with a customer in order to evaluate it. The product was still clearly in development, because end-user technical requirements were being developed and analyzed by both the customer care team and product-engineering team to be included in future more advanced versions of the technology.</p>  <p>At the end of the year the finance group was responsible for calculating the expenditures incurred in the year on eligible projects. The following is a summary of the resources by department:</p>

 <p>In this particular year, there was no single system that the controller could rely on to quickly get the costing associated with the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> projects. It was apparent that a variety of allocation methods and control systems would have to be used to calculate the labour expenditures associated with the projects.</p>  <p>The controller had access to records of the salary or wages paid to the employees for the year from the payroll service. The controller set up a spreadsheet listing all of the employees along with the salary or wages data received from the payroll service. The controller then proceeded to take a look at each employee to allocate the salary or wages to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work. She also considered what information would be available to serve as a control should a review occur along with information on how to set up a better system in the future. The controller planned to file a claim using the proxy method to calculate the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> tax incentives.</p>  <p><strong>The founders</strong> </p>  <p>The controller determined that three of the founders worked on the architecture throughout the year. She explained to these individuals that for salary or wages related to ongoing <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> projects claimed in the year, a number of things were considered as directly engaged. These things included:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>experimentation and analysis;</li> 
 <li> <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk">support work</a>;</li> 
 <li>direct supervision of employees performing experimentation and analysis;</li> 
 <li>technological documentation for internal use;</li> 
 <li>technological planning and analysis.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The controller asked if any of the three founders did other tasks that consumed more than 10% of their effort in the year. The founders reviewed their calendars, diaries, and notebooks, and concluded that they had not performed non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work that consumed more than 10% of their effort in the year. The controller considered these to provide a reasonable control that could serve to cross check for their conclusions during a <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> review. She concluded that these three founders were all or substantially all directly engaged in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>, and therefore 100% of the effort of three of the founders should be included in the <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> claim.</p>  <p>A similar approach was used with the fourth founder. After reviewing the founder's diary, the controller noted that the founder had spent two months, 17% (2 / 12) of the time, working alongside the other founders on the architecture or doing <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. After the first two months, the work switched to non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> business activities such as securing financing. The founder stated that he participated in all the technical strategy meetings providing technical direction and estimated that his total involvement in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> was about 50% of his time. The controller recognized that this was an estimate and may not be acceptable to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>  <p>As a result, the controller tried to identify another approach to quantify the labour allocation. She noted that the technical strategy meetings occurred on Tuesday of every second week and that they typically lasted for three hours. That meant the fourth founder spent 60 hours in the last 10 months (3 hours x 2 (twice a month) x 10 months) involved in <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> or about two weeks effort. The controller confirmed the reasonableness of this approach with the founder. This was much lower than the 50% level, but did increase the level to 21% (2.5 / 12 months). Even though there were no time records for these meetings, the controller thought that the methodology was reasonable and claimed on this basis.</p>  <p>As a final step, the controller noted that each of the founders retained enough ownership interest to be specified shareholders and that this fact would need to be considered in any calculation.</p>  <p><strong>Research and development</strong> </p>  <p>The <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> group operated in a dedicated environment and only spent their time performing <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work. The controller planned to cost 100% of the salary or wages of each <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> team member to the project, but first planned to discuss her approach with the system architect to make sure the team members were not performing other activities.</p>  <p>The system architect reviewed his monthly summaries and agreed with the approach in general, with two exceptions. In one case, a team member took sick leave for two months and was not available for the project. The controller planned to reduce the percentage to account for the sick leave. In the second case a team member was loaned to the customer care group for three months. Again, the controller planned to reduce the percentage for that team member to account for the non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work. Subject to those adjustments, the software architect agreed that the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> team was directly engaged in the project, and that 100% of the salary or wages should be allocated to the project.</p>  <p><strong>Product engineering</strong> </p>  <p>The system architect also pointed out that some of the product engineering team participated in the project. An analysis of the project scheduling and resource allocation tools used by the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> team showed that in the last seven months each of the product engineers spent about two months helping with the architecture. The product engineering team was employed for only seven months of the year, so the controller planned to allocate 29% (2 / 7 months) of their time to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> projects.</p>  <p><strong>Customer care</strong> </p>  <p>It was recognized that the customer care group was developing and collecting the technical requirements that were being incorporated into the architecture. There was plenty of evidence to show that the technical requirements were being developed, collected, and presented to the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> team. There was no indication of the percentage of time a customer-care agent spent collecting the requirements. To determine that percentage, the controller sat with a customer-care agent and reviewed the work performed by the agent in the last month. It was determined that the agent spent 20% of her time collecting and documenting technical requirements. Based on this analysis, the controller allocated 20% of the time of each customer-care agent to the project as directly engaged salary or wages.</p>  <p><strong>Quality control</strong> </p>  <p>The quality control group performed testing and quality control functions on all codes that were written by the company, whether it came from the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> team or the product engineering team. The controller decided to allocate to <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> the work of the quality control team based on the same ratio of <abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> to non-<abbr title="Scientific Research and Experimental Development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work performed by the <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> and product engineering teams.</p>  <p><strong>Documentation</strong> </p>  <p>The technical writer working in the documentation group spent all of his time writing documentation for external users that was incorporated into user manuals. The controller did not include this person's work in the claim.</p>  <p><strong>Other groups</strong> </p>  <p>The salary or wages of the finance, marketing, and sales people were clearly not directly engaged and were not included in the claim.</p>  <p>As a final measure, the time-sheet tracking system was reviewed to identify any extended vacation, flex days, or sick leave time that should be allocated to non-eligible activities.</p>
