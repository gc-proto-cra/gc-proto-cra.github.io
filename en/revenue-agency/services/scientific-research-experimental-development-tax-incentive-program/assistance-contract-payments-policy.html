	<h2>Changes to the Assistance and Contract Payments Policy</h2>
	<p><strong>Revision reasons</strong></p> 
<p>This revision accommodates the legislative changes that have been announced.</p> 
<p><strong>Revision overview</strong></p> 
<p>The 2012 Federal budget announced a number of changes in respect of the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>) Program:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Expenditure of a capital nature no longer qualifies for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> tax incentives after 2013.</li> 
 <li>The rate at which overhead <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures are accounted for under the proxy method are reduced from 65% to 55% over a two year period starting with 2013.</li> 
 <li>Contract–<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> and third‑party payments for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures are 80% eligible for Investment Tax Credits (<abbr title="investment Tax Credits">ITCs</abbr>) after 2012.</li> 
 <li>The basic 20% investment tax credit (<abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr>) for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> qualified expenditures is reduced to 15% after 2013.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The legislation for these proposals was enacted on December 14, 2012.</p> 
<p>A legislative amendment in Bill C-4 (received royal assent on December 12, 2013) revised the definition of non-government assistance effective December 21, 2012.</p> 
<p>The text of this document has been revised to reflect these changes, see <a href="#ppx3_1">Appendix C.1 Explanation of changes</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="s4_1_1">4.1.1 Government assistance</h4>
 <p>"Government assistance" is defined in the <em>Income Tax Act</em> as assistance from a government, municipality, or other public authority whether as a grant, subsidy, forgivable loan, deduction from tax, investment allowance, or any other form of assistance other than the federal <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc">investment tax credit (<abbr title="Investment tax credit">ITC</abbr>)</a>.</p>  <p>Although consideration should also be given to the nature of the functions performed by an entity, a public authority is generally an entity that:</p>  <ul>

 <li>is subject to a significant degree of government control; and</li> 
 <li>uses its profits for the benefit of the public.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Government assistance also includes assistance provided by a crown corporation or a foreign government.</p>  <p>Paragraph 12(1)(x) of the Act and related provisions concerning government assistance also apply to claimants who receive assistance indirectly from a government organization (unless the assistance was received before 1999 under an agreement in writing that was made before February 24, 1998). This includes assistance received from a non-profit entity that, in turn, receives its funding from a government organization.</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative References </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Paragraph 12(1)(x) Inducement, reimbursement, etc.<br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “government assistance”</p>

 <p>"Non-government assistance" is defined in the Act as an amount that would be included in a claimant's income under paragraph 12(1)(x) read without reference to subparagraphs 12(1)(x)(v) to (vii). Essentially, non-government assistance is an amount that can reasonably be considered to have been received as an inducement, reimbursement, contribution, allowance or as assistance for the cost of a property or for an outlay or expense. Non-government assistance may be in the form of a grant, subsidy, forgivable loan, deduction from tax, allowance or any other form of inducement or assistance.</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative References </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Paragraph 12(1)(x) Inducement, reimbursement, etc<br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “non-government assistance”</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s4_2_1">4.2.1 Factors used to determine whether an amount is assistance</h4>
 <p>Determining whether an amount received by a claimant is assistance will depend on the particular facts of the case. An analysis is required of all circumstances relating to the payment to determine if the amount is to be treated as assistance. The following describes some factors that may distinguish assistance from other types of payments. None of the following is in itself conclusive:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>The absence of firm terms of repayment on a loan could indicate that the amount received is not a loan, but is assistance. For example, if an amount received is only repayable conditionally upon the claimant meeting certain revenue expectations, then it is likely assistance, not a loan<strong>.</strong> </li> 
 <li>A review of the facts indicates that the repayments are not mandatory and the amount given is to be used for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. An example would be the case of a grant by a government department to a claimant to purchase equipment for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>.</li> 
 <li>The absence of a business motive on the part of the payer may indicate that the claimant is in receipt of assistance. In the CCLC Technologies Inc. decision (96 DTC 6527), the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ruled that the payments made by the province of Alberta to the claimant constituted both "government assistance" (see <a href="#s4_1_1">section 4.1.1</a>) and "any other form of assistance". The <abbr title="Federal Court of Appeal">FCA</abbr> decision suggests that the real test is, whether the payments were made "in exactly the same way for exactly the same reasons as payments made by private business, that is, for the purpose of advancing the interests of the payor."&nbsp;The terms of the agreement did not establish an ordinary business relationship, since the payments were not made to advance the business interest of the payer or to acquire an interest in the property.</li> 
 <li>To the extent that a government is not making an ordinary commercial investment for the contributions that it makes to a claimant, the government would be providing assistance as per the definition of "government assistance". In the Radio Engineering Products Limited decision (73 DTC 5071), the Federal Court held that the character of the payment from the Department of Defence Production was that of a contribution to the costs of the project, and although there were provisions for repayment and contingencies, it was not a loan or an advance in the nature of a loan of capital or a payment on a capital account.</li> 
</ul>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative References </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(iv) Inducement, reimbursement, etc<br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “government assistance”</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s4_2_2">4.2.2 The context of the assistance agreement</h4>
 <p>Determining whether an amount is assistance will depend on the substance of the agreement(s) rather than only on the words used in the agreement(s). The terms of the agreement are important in determining whether an amount received is assistance. For example, if an agreement for government assistance includes provisions for repayment only in the event of profits earned from the project and characterizes the repayments as royalties, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> considers the amounts to be government assistance, not a business loan. These arrangements are usually referred to as forgivable loans, since they include conditions that would exempt the borrower from repaying the whole amount or a portion of the amount.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s4_2_3">4.2.3 Example – Forgivable loan</h4>
 <p>Under a government program, a government department makes financial contributions to the research and development (<abbr title="Research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) programs of corporations. The agreements under which the contributions are made contain repayment provisions, but these provisions contain certain conditions:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>The repayments are dependent on future revenues from the developed product, and no amount is repayable until such revenues reach a certain level.</li> 
 <li>There is a ceiling on the amount of the periodic repayments, and the periodic repayments end on a set date whether or not the entire amount has been repaid.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Unless the facts of a case warrant otherwise, generally, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> treats these contributions as assistance due to the conditions attached to the repayments. The assistance would reduce the&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#plddct">pool of deductible&nbsp;<abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfsrd">qualified <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures</a> accordingly.</p>

Hence assistance for one project cannot reduce the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures of another project. Also, government or non-government assistance can only reduce the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures of a project to nil. In no case would the reduction result in an <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project having a negative amount for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures.</p>  <p>In cases where the amount of assistance is more than the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures of a project, the excess amount will be included as income in the tax year.

 <p>The Province of Quebec has a variety of <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits. At the time of writing this document, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> considers only the following four Quebec <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits to be assistance for the purposes of the pool of deductible <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures and qualified <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>tax credit for salaries and wages (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>);</li> 
 <li>tax credit for university research or research carried out by a public research centre or a research consortium;</li> 
 <li>tax credit for private partnership precompetitive research; and</li> 
 <li>tax credit for fees or dues paid to a research consortium.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Generally, the tax legislation of the Province of Quebec is designed to prevent a claimant from receiving tax assistance for an expenditure that may give rise to more than one tax credit. An expenditure may qualify for two different Quebec tax credits, and the facts may show that a claimant chose to earn credit under a program that is not a Quebec <abbr title="Research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> program. In such a case, the amount of assistance in respect of that expenditure will not be considered to be government assistance (see <a href="#s4_1_1">section 4.1.1</a>) for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> purposes.

        <h3 id="s5_2">5.2 Definition of a contract payment</h3>
 <p>A <strong>contract payment</strong> is:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>an amount paid or payable to a claimant by a&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tspplr">taxable supplier</a> in respect of the amount for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>:

  </ul> </li> 
 <li>an amount for an expenditure of a current nature (other than a <strong>prescribed amount</strong>) payable by a Canadian government, municipality or other Canadian public authority (see <a href="#s4_1_1">section 4.1.1</a>) or by a person exempt from Part I tax under section 149 of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> to be performed for it or on its behalf.</li> 
</ul>  <p>In this context, a <strong>prescribed amount</strong> is an amount received from the Canadian Commercial Corporation in respect of an amount received by that corporation from a foreign government, foreign municipality or other foreign public authority.</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative References </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Subparagraph 37(1)(a)(i.01) Pool of deductible <abbr title="Scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures – current expenditures, on behalf<br/> Subparagraph 37(1)(a)(i.1) Pool of deductible <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures – third-party payments to a corporation<br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “contract payment”<br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “taxable supplier”</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative Reference </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Regulations</strong> </em><br/> Section 4606 Prescribed amount</p>

        <h3 id="s5_3">5.3 Differences between assistance and contract payments</h3>
 <p>Some essential features that distinguish assistance from a contract payment (see <a href="#s5_2">section&nbsp;5.2</a>) are:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Assistance involves predominantly a donative intent, rather than a business motive. An assistance agreement between the grantor and the recipient of the assistance will show that the main purpose of the agreement from the grantor's point of view was something other than profit. Contract payments are payments for <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> that is performed&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nbhlf">on behalf of</a> the payer.</li> 
 <li>Any repayment provisions in an assistance agreement are not strictly enforceable. A contract is a commercial arrangement between two or more parties, subject to legal liabilities and enforceable in the case of default.</li> 
 <li>A contract arrangement implies authority of the payer over the deliverables and sometimes over the whole work process. Assistance does not generally extend such implications. However, some assistance agreements could include restrictions in respect of such things as how the work is to be done or where a product can be sold.</li> 
</ul>

        <h3 id="s5_4">5.4 Who is entitled to an investment tax credit?</h3>
 <p>Based on the terms of a contract, it may be difficult to determine whether it is the person who paid the amount (the payer) or the contractor (the performer) who is entitled to an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nvstmnttc"> <abbr title="Investment tax credit">ITC</abbr> </a>. This question can arise when a contract does not specify whether an amount paid to the contractor who performed the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work is a contract payment (see <a href="#s5_2">section&nbsp;5.2</a>) for the purpose of calculating an <abbr title="investment tax credit">ITC</abbr>. Even though a contract states that a payment is, or is not, a contract payment, this may not be conclusive. This could be the case if the substance of a contract is different from what is stated.</p>  <p>There is no unique test or jurisprudence that will determine if an amount paid is a contract payment.</p>  <p class="small"> <strong>Legislative Reference </strong> <em> <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> </em><br/> Subsection 127(9) Definition of “contract payment”</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="s5_5">5.5 Criteria to consider</h3>
 <p>The criteria discussed in <a href="#s5_5_1">sections 5.5.1 through 5.5.4</a> are applicable to all claimants regardless of whether the contract payment (see <a href="#s5_2">section 5.2</a>) is from a payer that is:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>a person or partnership; or</li> 
 <li>a Canadian government, municipality, or other Canadian public authority (see <a href="#s4_1_1">section 4.1.1</a>) or a person exempt from Part&nbsp;I tax.</li> 
</ul>  <p>These criteria should be considered in assessing the nature of the payment. The key element to consider is whether the payer is requesting the contractor to perform <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nbhlf">on behalf of</a> the payer under the terms of the contract. An analysis is required of all circumstances relating to the payment to determine if the amount is to be treated as a contract payment.</p>  <p>None of the criteria are, in themselves, conclusive.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s5_5_1">5.5.1 Contractor performance requirements</h4>
 <p>Does the contract state that the contractor was required to perform specific <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work (for example, "The contractor shall design, integrate, test, and verify performance.")? The question is not whether <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work was carried out, but whether <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> was carried out because it was <strong>required</strong> under the contract.</p>  <p>Are there specifications that the contractor had to comply with in performing the contractor's tasks?</p>  <p>These two elements may indicate that the contractor had to perform <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> on behalf of the payer, meaning that the amount paid is a contract payment.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s5_5_2">5.5.2 Pricing <abbr title="versus">vs.</abbr> risks assumed</h4>
 <p>Is there a ceiling price beyond which the contractor would not have been paid? If <strong>yes</strong>, it may indicate that the contractor had to assume risks under the contract because the contractor would be responsible for costs above the ceiling price.</p>  <p>A ceiling price clause may raise doubts as to whether the contractor had to perform <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> on behalf of the payer. If the contractor agreed to absorb extra costs related to the project, this may indicate that the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> was being carried out by, and at the risk of, the contractor and not on behalf of the payer.</p>  <p>Would the contractor have been entitled to payments if the work did not meet the requirements of work to be performed under the contract? If <strong>yes</strong>, it may indicate that the risks taken by the contractor were limited, that is, risks rested with the payer, even if there was a ceiling price clause. This would support the position that the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work was carried out on behalf of the payer.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong><br/> A repayment because the work stopped or the other obligations of the contractor were not fulfilled should not be considered in making the determination.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="s5_5_3">5.5.3 Intellectual property</h4>
 <p>If the rights to the intellectual property (<abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr>) of the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work belong to the contractor, this may indicate that the contractor was not required to perform <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> for or on behalf of the payer since the results of the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> remain with the contractor.</p>  <p>The payer may have a conditional right to use the results of the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr>. However, the existence of a conditional right suggests that the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> was not performed on behalf of the payer, since the payer is not permitted to use the results of the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> as desired.</p>  <p>A distinction can be made in the case of a contract with the Crown. The fact that the <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr> rests with the contractor rather than the Crown does not necessarily have a notable effect on the qualification of a payment as a contract payment. As with the other criteria, the ownership of the <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr> is only one factor that will help in the global analysis of the payments.</p>  <p>There are two particular situations requiring clarification with respect to the <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr> criteria:</p>  <ol> 
 <li>For contracts with the Crown, it is Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat policy* that <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr> developed by a contractor during the course of a crown procurement contract stay with the contractor.</li> 
 <li>For contracts with universities, the university usually owns the rights to the <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr>. Consider the following questions: 
  <ul> 
   <li>Does the university have the capacity or intent to exploit the results of the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> done by the performer?</li> 
   <li>Is the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> that was performed within the scope of research that would normally be done by the university?</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ol>  <p>Answering <strong>yes</strong> to these questions would indicate that the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> was performed on behalf of the university.</p>  <p class="small">* Policy on title to&nbsp;intellectual property arising&nbsp;under crown procurement contracts</p>

        <h4 id="s5_5_4">5.5.4 Contract for services <abbr title="versus">vs.</abbr> contract for the sale of goods</h4>
 <p>Where a definite conclusion cannot be made using the other criteria, determining whether a contract is a contract for service or a contract for the sale of a good (based on the substance of the contract) may provide some guidance.</p>  <p>A contract for service may indicate that the <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> work was being performed on behalf of the payer.
