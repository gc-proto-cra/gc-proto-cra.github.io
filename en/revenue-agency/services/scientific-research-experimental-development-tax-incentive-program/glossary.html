<p>Analysis is the detailed examination of information to differentiate the various parts of a whole, determine their attributes, or explain their relationships.

<p id="bt"><strong>Beta site testing</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beta site testing is the <a href="#tstng">testing</a> or validation of a product or process in a customer or an end-user facility or environment. Often, the need for this type of testing arises when the product or process that is being developed cannot be tested in isolation without the full process environment, or in cases where the developer is unable to simulate the specialized environment or conditions required to evaluate the product performance.</p>
<p>While beta site testing is a commonly used term, depending on the industry or <a href="#tchnlgy">technology</a> involved, other terms may be used to characterize the type of testing discussed above. These terms include for example, field testing, field investigation, field trials, validation, offsite testing, consumer testing, in-situ testing, end-use testing, final verification, or on-orbit or on-mission testing.

<p>Engineering is the practice of designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing, or supervising the construction or manufacturing of tangible products, assemblies, systems, or processes that requires in-depth knowledge of engineering science and the proper, safe, and economic application of engineering principles.</p>

<p>A prototype is an original model on which something new is patterned and of which all things of the same type are representations or copies. It is a basic experimental model that possesses the essential characteristics of the intended product. A prototype is normally understood to be a trial model or preliminary version. It is developed to test the feasibility of a concept or <a href="#hypthss">hypothesis</a> within a <a href="#systmnv">systematic investigation or search</a> and generally has no lasting value.</p>

<p id="psycrsrch"><strong>Psychological research</strong></p>
<p>Psychological research is research into the functions of the mind and the behaviour of humans or animals in relation to their environment.</p>
<p>The definition of <a href="#srd"><abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr></a> specifically excludes work with respect to research in the <a href="#sclsc">social sciences</a> or the <a href="#hmnts">humanities</a>. Psychology is a social science; however, paragraph (d) of the definition of <abbr title="Scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> lists psychological research work as eligible work when it is undertaken <a href="#spprt">directly in support</a> of an <abbr title="Scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project in a field of <a href="#scn">science</a> or <a href="#tchnlgy">technology</a> other than the social sciences or humanities. Only the work with respect to psychological research that is <a href="#cmmnsrt">commensurate with the needs</a> and directly in support of an <abbr title="Scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> project can be claimed.</p>
<p>For example, in many projects involving interaction between human and machine, the interaction between a human operator and the device that he or she is controlling poses a complex technological problem. Major contributing factors are the physiological, neurological, and other limitations of the human operator, considered as an element within a servo system. The effect of these limitations implies that changes to the purely physical elements comprised in the system may be necessary, and that these changes can be best undertaken by simulation or actual (or real) testing with the human operator in the servo loop. Adjustments or modifications to the system are made until a point is reached where the human operator can carry out a prescribed task without excessive physical or neurological effort. Certain aspects of psychological research may also be involved in this kind of development. Work with respect to this type of psychological research that is directly in support and commensurate with the needs of <a href="#bscrsrch">basic research</a>, <a href="#ppldrsrch">applied research</a> or <a href="#xpdvlpmnt">experimental development</a> is considered eligible.</p>
