  <li><a href="#h3">Get support with eligibility</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Fundamental requirements of SR&amp;ED</h2>
<p>Eligible work must meet certain fundamental requirements to be considered scientific research and experimental development.</p>
		 <p>Your reason for doing the work (<strong>why</strong> you started it) and the way in which you approach the work (<strong>how</strong> you carry it out) will help determine if the work is in fact SR&amp;ED. </p>
<p> Eligible SR&amp;ED work must include the 3 following items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A scientific or technological <strong>uncertainty</strong> that you tried to overcome</li>
	<li>A systematic <strong>investigation or search</strong> that you carried out to overcome the uncertainty</li>
	<li>An <strong>advancement</strong> that you achieved or tried to achieve</li>
</ul>
		 <p>Review the legal definition of SR&amp;ED: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_1">SR&amp;ED is defined in the Income Tax Act</a></p>
		 
<h3>The uncertainty </h3>
<p>SR&amp;ED work must be based on a  scientific or technological uncertainty that you are trying to overcome. </p>
<p>The uncertainty may exist because of a current gap or limitation in the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scntfctchnlgclknwldg">scientific or technological knowledge</a>   available at the time. It is the reason for starting the SR&amp;ED work.</p>
<p> You must be able to explain  the gap in the existing knowledge when you started the work, the uncertainty, and your attempt to resolve the uncertainty.  </p>
<h3><a>The investigation or [re]search</a></h3>
<p>The work to overcome the uncertainty must be carried out through experiment and analysis. It is not sufficient to simply use known design methods or established techniques.</p>
<p>The work must be a systematic investigation or search.</p>
<p>You must be able to explain the work that was done and describe how you gained the knowledge you needed to overcome the uncertainty.</p>
             
<details>             
<summary>What a systematic investigation includes</summary>
	<p>The systematic investigation or search required by the SR&ED tax incentive program is more than simply having a systematic approach to your work. It must include all the following:</p>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
  <dt>A hypothesis</dt>
  <dd>The idea that triggers your investigation to overcome the uncertainty (it may be a possible solution to a problem, a proposed method, or an approach).</dd>
  <dt>An experiment</dt>
  <dd>The experiment or analysis conducted to test your hypothesis, which may change or evolve as a result of the testing.</dd>
  <dt>Results</dt>
  <dd>The results obtained or findings of the experiment or analysis.</dd>
	<dt>Conclusions</dt>
  <dd>The logical conclusions that are based on the results obtained.</dd>
</dl>
	
</details>
    
<h3>The advancement</h3>
<p>The advancement is the increase in knowledge that  your SR&amp;ED work achieved. It&rsquo;s how the work improved the scientific or  technological knowledge base that existed when you started the work. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s the advancement in the  underlying science or technology that is important, not how the work advanced  your business or business practices.</p>
<p> You <strong>do not have to achieve your objective</strong> to gain new knowledge. </p>
<p> For example, if your work allowed you to  understand that the idea you tested is not a solution for your situation, this  can be considered new knowledge. </p>
		 
<h2 id="h2">Eligible research and development work</h2>
<p>Work that is  eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives must be in the fields of science or  technology and must be carried out in Canada. Eligible types of research and development work include the following:</p>
<h3>Basic  research<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Basic research is work that aims to increase the scientific or technological knowledge base. It often takes place in laboratories and may be published in scientific journals. </p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of basic research</summary>
  <p>An example of basic research is the study of a newly discovered virus to better understand its  characteristics.</p>
</details>

<h3>Applied research</h3>
<p>Applied research is also work that aims to increase scientific or technological knowledge, but it has a specific practical application in view. Like basic research, the work often takes place in laboratories and may be published in scientific journals.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of applied research</summary>
  <p>An example of applied research would be efforts to  develop a vaccine against a new virus by exploiting some identified characteristics of that newly discovered virus.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Experimental  development<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Experimental development is work that aims to achieve a technological advancement that creates or improves materials, devices, products, or processes. This also includes incremental improvements.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of experimental development</summary>
  <p>An example of when experimental development could occur might be during the scale up and optimization of processes to enable large scale and rapid production of a vaccine.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Eligible support work </h3>
<p><a>Support work is not SR&amp;ED, but  it may be eligible if it <strong>corresponds and directly supports the SR&amp;ED work</strong> you&rsquo;re doing. </a></p>
<p> Types  of eligible support work: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a>engineering</a></li>
  <li>design</li>
  <li>operations research</li>
  <li>mathematical analysis</li>
  <li>computer programming</li>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>psychological research<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>Example of support work</summary>
  <p>For example, if you are developing a vaccine, you may perform tests on the virus to observe its  characteristics. This testing would be considered support work of your basic research.</p>
</details>

<!--<p> Types  of eligible support work: </p>
<ul>

  <li>computer programming</li>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>psychological research<br>
  </li>
</ul>-->
		 
<h3>Work that is not eligible </h3>
<p><a>Some work is specifically excluded  from being eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives. Any work that is <strong>not  conducted specifically to </strong></a><strong>overcome  the uncertainty is not eligible</strong>. </p>
<details>             
<summary> Review types of excluded work</summary>
<p>  The following work  is <strong>not eligible</strong> or considered support work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Market research or sales promotion</li>
  <li>Quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes</li>
  <li>Research in the social sciences or the  humanities</li>
  <li>Prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or  producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas</li>
  <li>The commercial production of a new or improved material, device, or product, or the commercial use of a new or improved process</li>
  <li>Style changes</li>
  <li>Routine data collection</li>
  <li>Acquiring available knowledge or know-how (such as, through training) </li>
  <li>On-the-job learning, hiring expert employees or  consultants, or purchasing proprietary knowledge </li>
</ul>
</details>
<!--<h2>If you receive other R&amp;D tax credits</h2>
<p>Receiving R&amp;D <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/summary-provincial-territorial-research-development-tax-credits-december-31-2016.html">tax credits through your province or territory</a> does not exclude you from claiming SR&amp;ED tax incentives. However, it may reduce the amount you can claim.</p>
<p>You must report any financial assistance you receive in your SR&amp;ED expenditures claim.</p>-->
<h2 id="h3">Get support with eligibility </h2>
<h3>Assess the eligibility of your work</h3>
<p>Use the  Self-assessment and learning tool (SALT) to understand if your work may qualify  as SR&amp;ED work.</p>
