</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Identify your allowable expenditures</h2>
<p>Your allowable expenditures represent the expenditures you incurred conducting SR&ED work. To claim  SR&amp;ED tax incentives, you need to calculate how much you spent in relation to your SR&amp;ED work during the tax year. This means linking your eligible work to the  expenditures you can claim. <br>
  You may claim the following expenditures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Salary or wages </li>
  <li>Materials (consumed or transformed)</li>
  <li>Contracts for SR&amp;ED</li>
  <li>Overhead and other expenditures (traditional method only)</li>
  <li>Third party payments</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only claim expenditures for the year in which they occurred.</p>
<h3 id="h2">Select the calculation method: traditional or proxy</h3>
<p>To calculate your allowable expenditures, you may choose to use either the <strong>traditional method</strong> or the <strong>proxy method</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Using the traditional method, you must identify all your overhead and other expenditures</li>
               <li>Using the proxy method, you use a substitute (or proxy) amount instead</li>
            </ul>
 <p>Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. You must decide what is most suitable for your business.</p>
            <p>For more information about the proxy or traditional methods, refer to the section <a href="#h6">Overhead and other expenditures</a>.</p>
          
<h2 id="h3">Salary or wages</h2>
<p>Allowable salary or wage expenditures include the portion of salary or wages that you incurred in the tax year for SR&amp;ED work done in Canada. The amounts must be paid by the end of the tax year (or within 180 days of the end of the tax year).</p>
<p> You may include the salary or wages of employees who are <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nggd">directly engaged</a> in SR&amp;ED doing hands-on work.</p>
<p> The portion of salary or wages you include must be based on the time employees spent on  SR&amp;ED activities and the tasks they performed, regardless of their job title. </p>

<details>             
<summary>Review tasks that may qualify as salary or wage expenditures</summary>
<p>The following tasks are considered directly engaged in SR&amp;ED work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation and analysis</li>
  <li>Support work of engineering, design, operations research, mathematical analysis, computer programming, data collection,  testing, or psychological research</li>
  <li>Certain tasks performed by non-specialized  employees, such as:
      <ul class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>operating a machine that is required for an  experiment</li>
        <li>feeding raw materials into a machine
            <p>(must be supervised by staff with scientific or technological qualifications)</p></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supervision of employees performing SR&amp;ED, and SR&amp;ED contract administration and coordination (technical input only) </li>
  <li>Technological planning for ongoing SR&amp;ED projects you claimed in the tax year, such as  planning for:
    <ul>
      <li>assignment of technological personnel</li>
      <li>job priorities</li>
      <li>development  of technological strategies</li>
      <li>quality of materials used</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technological feasibility studies relating to SR&amp;ED projects carried out</li>
  <li>Technical documentation for internal use</li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Review criteria for claiming work outside Canada</summary>
 <p>In some cases, you may claim a portion of the salary or wages of employees who conducted SR&amp;ED work outside Canada. This portion is called the permissible salary.</p>
<p>The salary or wages you can claim for SR&amp;ED done outside Canada must meet <strong>all the following criteria</strong>:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> The SR&amp;ED work must be done directly by an employee and not a contractor</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> The employee who did the work was a resident of Canada at the time the expense was incurred</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> The work was related to the business of the claimant</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> The work done outside Canada was an integral part and solely in support of the  SR&amp;ED project carried out in Canada</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> The salary or wages paid must not be subject to income or profits tax from another country </li>
</ul>
   <p>To learn more about salary or wages of employees outside Canada, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/salary-wages-policy.html#s10_0">Section 10, SR&amp;ED Salary or Wages Policy</a></p>
   </details> 
            <p>For employees <strong>not directly engaged</strong> in SR&amp;ED work, such as clerical staff, you may be able to claim their salary or wages as <a href="#h6">Overhead and other expenditures</a> (traditional method only).</p>
            <p>For detailed information about salary or wages, review the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/salary-wages-policy.html">SR&amp;ED Salary or Wages Policy</a>.</p>

 <h2 id="h4">Materials</h2>
<p>Materials for SR&amp;ED include all the <strong>raw materials, substances, or other items</strong> that compose the body of a thing at any time during the SR&amp;ED work carried out in the tax year.</p>
<p> Expenditures may include the original cost to acquire an item plus all reasonable costs to bring that item to the condition and location required to be <strong>consumed or transformed</strong> as part the SR&amp;ED work.</p>

<details>             
<summary>What are materials consumed</summary>
<p> Materials consumed during SR&amp;ED are materials that were destroyed or made valueless as a  result of the work. This includes materials that were absorbed, used up, or broken down into small pieces.</p>
</details>
<details>             
<summary>What are materials transformed</summary>
<p> Materials transformed during SR&amp;ED are materials that have been changed or incorporated into another material or product, and that retain some value to you or another party.</p>
   <!--<p> Add content about recapture </p>-->
   <p>For detailed information about production runs and developing assets, review:</p>
   <ul>
        <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/production-runs-policy-1.html">SR&amp;ED During Production Runs Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/while-developing-asset.html">SR&amp;ED while Developing an Asset Policy</a></li>
   </ul>
</details>  
<p>Determining if an item is a material for SR&amp;ED is a question of fact that can only be made on a case-by-case basis.</p> 
<p>When an item does not qualify as material for SR&amp;ED, the associated cost may be allowable as an <a href="#h6">overhead or other expenditure</a> (traditional method only).</p>
 <p> If you purchase materials that you will use later in SR&amp;ED work, you may only claim their cost  in the year that the materials are consumed or transformed. </p>
<p>For detailed information about materials, review the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/materials-policy.html">Materials for SR&amp;ED Policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h5">Contracts for SR&amp;ED work</h2>
<p>You may claim the  amount you paid or that was payable to contractors or sub-contractors who did  SR&amp;ED work in Canada on your behalf during the tax year. </p>
<p> You must separate your contract expenditures between <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rmslngth">arm&rsquo;s length</a> contractors and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nl">non-arm&rsquo;s  length</a> contractors.</p>
            <ul>
<li> Arm&rsquo;s length contracts can be included in the calculation of qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures for an investment tax credit (ITC) </li>
<li> Non-arm&rsquo;s length contracts  can be included in the calculation of deductible expenditures, but they do not  qualify for an ITC</li>
            </ul>
<p>For detailed information about contracts, review the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/contract-expenditures-performed-on-behalf-a-claimant-policy.html">Contract Expenditures for SR&amp;ED Performed on Behalf of a Claimant Policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h6">Overhead and other expenditures</h2>
<p>All overhead and other expenditures must be <strong>directly attributable</strong> to conducting SR&ED work in Canada.</p>
            <p>The expenditure must be directly related to the SR&amp;ED work and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrmntl">incremental</a>, meaning the expenditure would not have been incurred if the work had not happened.</p>
            <p>You may choose to use either the <strong>traditional method</strong> or the <strong>proxy method</strong> to calculate your expenditures for the tax year you&rsquo;re claiming. But to calculate your overhead and other expenditures, you must use the traditional method. If you choose the proxy method, you will  use the substitute amount instead.</p>
 <p>You cannot change the method you chose after you have submitted your SR&amp;ED claim.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t  select a method, the CRA will process your claim using the traditional method.</p>
 <details>
    <summary>Using the traditional method</summary>         
<p>The traditional  method is the only way to calculate overhead and other expenditures. It requires you to specifically identify each overhead cost that was directly related and incremental to SR&amp;ED work as "overhead and other expenditures".</p>    
<p><strong>Advantages of the traditional method</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Must specifically identify the overhead and other expenditures that are directly related and  incremental to the SR&amp;ED work</li>
  <li>Can  be complex in certain situations, such as when SR&amp;ED and non-SR&amp;ED work are done in the same facility (for example, shop-floor SR&amp;ED)</li>
  <li>Must identify (track) and allocate which overhead and other expenditures are for the  SR&amp;ED work</li>
  <li>Must explain how you determined the amount and provide support for the determination</li>
  <li>The PPA may be greater than the actual overhead and other expenditures incurred</li>

         <summary>Using the proxy method</summary>
<p>If you use the proxy method, you do not need to specifically identify and claim SR&amp;ED overhead and other expenditures for the tax year. Instead you use a formula based on expenditures for salary or wages to calculate a substitute amount called the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prprxy">prescribed proxy amount</a> (PPA).</p>
	     <p>If you use the proxy method, you <strong>do not have to report</strong> the following amounts incurred for SR&amp;ED work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Salary or wages for support or clerical staff </li>
  <li>Office supplies</li>
  <li>Utilities</li>
</ul>          

<p><strong>Advantages of the proxy method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No need to specifically identify (track) and allocate overhead and other expenditures for SR&amp;ED</li>
  <li>Investment tax credit is earned on the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prprxy">PPA</a></li>
  <li>Easy to determine the PPA once you establish the salary base (PPA is calculated in  Part 5 of T661)</li>
  <li>Actual overhead and other expenditures incurred may be less than the PPA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of the proxy method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The&nbsp;PPA&nbsp;or any expenditures it represents cannot be included in the&nbsp;pool of       deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures</li>
  <li>The&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#slbs">salary base</a>&nbsp;must be calculated</li>
  <li>Overall cap on the PPA may need to be calculated</li>
  <li>the PPA may be less than the actual overhead and other expenditures incurred </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h7">Third-party payments</h2>
<p>A third-party payment for SR&amp;ED work carried out in Canada during the tax year may be claimed as an allowable expenditure if:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>the work is done by an approved third-party entity
 <details>
  <summary>Review approved third parties</summary>

            <p>Third-party payments can be direct financial contributions, funding for students or employees doing the SR&amp;ED work, or payments in kind. </p>
            <p>If you made a  third-party payment, you must complete Form T1263 for each payment and attach to your claim:</p>

<h3>How third-party payments differ from contract costs</h3>
<p>Third-party payments are different from <a href="#h5">Contracts for SR&amp;ED</a> in that the third party, such as a university or research institute, would have done the work anyway, regardless of your SR&amp;ED project.</p>

               <summary>Third-party payments vs contracts for SR&amp;ED work</summary>
               <h4>Third-party payment</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>The SR&amp;ED work is controlled by the performer </li>
                   <li>Rights to the work are non-exclusive (generally published) but there must be preferential right to the payer to exploit the results </li>
                   <li>Usually more than one payer</li>
                  <li>The SR&amp;ED work is often basic or applied research</li>
                   <li>Tax treatment is generally on a cash basis</li>
               </ul>
                <h4>Contracts for SR&amp;ED work</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>The SR&amp;ED work is controlled by the payer </li>
                   <li>Rights to the work are exclusive to the payer </li>
                   <li>Usually limited to one payer</li>
                   <li>The SR&amp;ED work often has a commercial focus </li>
