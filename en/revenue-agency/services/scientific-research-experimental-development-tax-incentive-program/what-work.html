</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Requirements for SR&amp;ED</h2>
<p>For your work to be eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives, it must be conducted in Canada and meet <strong>both</strong> of the following requirements:</p>	 
          
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The work must be conducted for  the advancement of scientific knowledge or for the purpose of achieving a  technological advancement</li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The work must be a systematic investigation or search  that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis</li>  
</ul>
    
<details>             
<summary>What is an advancement</summary>
	<p>An advancement is the generation or discovery of <strong>knowledge</strong> that your SR&amp;ED work achieved that moves the understanding of science or technology forward.</p>
	<p>You may have begun the work to overcome a scientific or technological uncertainty that you encountered due to a gap in the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl">scientific or technological knowledge base</a> that existed at the time.</p>
	<p>Overcoming the uncertainty and acheiving the new knowledge is the reason <strong>why</strong> the work is done. </p>
<p>You <strong>do not have to achieve your goal</strong> to gain new knowledge. For example, if your work allowed you to understand that the idea you tested is not a solution for your situation, this can be considered new knowledge.</p>
<p>It is the advancement in the underlying science or technology that is important, not how the work advanced your business or business practices.</p>
	<p>For detailed information, review <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_3">The "Why" requirement</a>.</p>
</details>    

<details>             
<summary>What is a systematic investigation or search</summary>
	<p>A systematic investigation or search refers to <strong>how</strong> SR&amp;ED work must be carried out. It is more than just having a systematic approach to your work, or using established techniques or protocols.</p>
	<p>A systematic investigation or search <strong>must include</strong> the following steps: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Defining a problem</li>
	<li>Advancing a hypothesis towards resolving that problem</li>
	<li>Planning and testing the hypothesis by experiment or analysis</li>
	<li>Developing logical conclusions based on the results</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For detailed information, review, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_4">The “How” requirement</a>.<p>
</details>
<p>Make sure that your work is <strong>eligible</strong> research and development (R&amp;D) or support work, and does not include <a href="#h4">work or activities you cannot claim</a>.</p>
		
<p>If you receive <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/sred/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/what-are.html#h2">other government funding</a> for R&amp;D, your work may still be eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</p>
		 
		 
<h2 id="h2">Eligible R&amp;D work</h2>
<p>Eligible types of research and development work include the following:</p>
<h3>Basic research<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Basic research is work that aims to advance scientific knowledge without  a specific practical application in view. It often takes place in laboratories  and may be published in scientific journals.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of basic research</summary>
  <p>An example of basic research is the study of a newly discovered virus to better understand its characteristics.</p>
</details>

<h3>Applied research</h3>
<p>Applied research is work that aims to advance  scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of applied research</summary>
  <p>An example of applied research would be efforts to develop a vaccine against a new virus by exploiting some identified characteristics of that newly discovered virus.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Experimental development<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Experimental development is work that aims to generate  or discover technical knowledge or know-how in order to develop  or improve materials, devices, products, or  processes (including  incremental improvements).</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of experimental development</summary>
  <p>For example, experimental development could occur during the scale up and optimization of processes to enable large scale and rapid production of a vaccine.</p>
</details>
   <p class="mrgn-tp-md">To review the legal definition of SR&amp;ED, refer to how <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_1">SR&amp;ED is defined in the Income Tax Act</a>.</p>	
		 
<h2 id="h3">Eligible support work</h2>
<p><a>Some support work may be eligible if it matches the needs and directly  supports the basic research, applied research, or experimental development work.</a></p>

<details>             
<summary>What is support work</summary>
<p>Eligible <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk">support  work</a> must directly support and be commensurate  with the needs of the basic research, applied research, or experimental  development work. This means it must correspond in the amount, size, extent, or  duration that is needed to carry out the SR&amp;ED work.</p>
</details>
<p>Eligible  support work must be in one of the following categories: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Engineering</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Design</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Operations  research</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Mathematical  analysis</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Computer  programming</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Data  collection</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Testing</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Psychological research</li>
</ul>
             
    <details>
      <summary>Example of support work</summary>
      <p>For example, if you are developing a vaccine, you may perform tests on the virus to observe its characteristics. This testing would be considered support work of your basic research.</p>
    </details>
      
      
  <h2 id="h4">Work that is not eligible </h2>
	<p>Some work is specifically excluded from being eligible for SR&ED tax incentives, while other work activities aren&rsquo;t eligible because they do not meet the requirements.</p>
	<h3>Excluded work</h3>
		 <p>Some work is specifically excluded from being eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</p>
		 <p>The following work is <strong>not eligible</strong> and cannot be claimed:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Market  research or sales promotion</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Quality  control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Research  in the social sciences or the humanities</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Prospecting,  exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> The commercial production of a new or improved material, device, or product, or the commercial use of a new or improved process</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Style  changes</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Routine data collection</li>
</ul>
      
<details>             
        <summary>Example of excluded work</summary>
        <p>For example, you may carry out data collection as a routine activity for supporting normal business operations. This routinely collected data may also be useful to your SR&amp;ED work. However, since the purpose of the data collection is to support normal business operations, it is excluded from the work you can claim for SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if data collection is carried out to directly support the SR&amp;ED work, then it would be eligible as support work. This is because it is carried out specifically for the purpose of performing SR&amp;ED.</p>
      </details>             
<h3>Other activities you cannot claim</h3>   
<p>Other activities related to acquiring knowledge do not meet the SR&ED requirement of achieving an advancement and are <strong>not eligible</strong>:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span>Training</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span>On-the-job learning</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span>Hiring expert employees or consultants with know-how</li>
	<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span>Purchasing proprietary knowledge</li>
</ul>
